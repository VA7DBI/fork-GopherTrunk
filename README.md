# GopherTrunk 📻🐹

A headless, low-latency digital-trunking scanner engine in Go.

GopherTrunk manages a pool of RTL-SDR dongles, runs a custom Go DSP pipeline,
and decodes the control channels of P25, DMR, and NXDN trunked radio systems
— with the engine pieces that follow voice grants, hold talkgroups by
priority, and stream metadata + audio to a frontend layered on top.

> **Status: under active development.** Phases 0 – 6 of the build plan have
> landed (foundation, SDR hardware, DSP core, P25 Phase 1 control channel,
> system-ID & CC hunter, DMR Tier III CSBK, NXDN frame structure, and the
> trunking engine — talkgroup DB + priority preemption + voice-device
> allocator + grant follower). The full phased roadmap lives in
> [`docs/phases.md`](docs/phases.md); the architectural overview is in
> [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

## What's intentionally deferred

The build plan calls these out by phase; the most visible items still ahead:

- Wiring the demod pipeline (channelizer → demod → protocol decoder) and
  the trunking engine into `cmd/gophertrunk run` so the daemon does
  end-to-end CC hunt → grant follow → audio.
- A composer that subscribes to `CallStart` events, spins up a per-call
  demod chain on the bound Voice device, calls `Engine.Touch` on each
  voice frame, and `Engine.EndCall` on a release announcement.
- BCH(63,16,11) for full P25 NID validation; P25-specific trellis tables and
  the TSBK block interleaver (so the P25 Phase 1 control channel can decode
  live captures end-to-end).
- Hamming(20,8) over the DMR slot-type field; SACCH FEC + sub-frame
  interleaver for NXDN.
- Voice frame decoding — IMBE for P25 Phase 1 lands as Phase 7; AMBE+2
  (P25 Phase 2 / DMR / NXDN) is gated behind a `mbelib` build tag for
  patent-licensing clarity.
- gRPC + WebSocket API surfaces (Phase 8), persistence + recording
  (Phase 9), and hardening (metrics, reconnect, Docker — Phase 10).

## ✨ Goals

- **Native concurrency.** Goroutines + typed channels carry IQ from the
  RTL-SDR async-read callback all the way through the DSP and protocol
  pipelines.
- **Multi-SDR pool.** Auto-discovery and Control / Voice role assignment
  across multiple dongles, with serial-number hints honored.
- **Protocols.** P25 Phase 1 & 2 (C4FM / H-DQPSK), DMR Tier II & III, NXDN
  4800 / 9600 baud.
- **Headless architecture.** Daemon with gRPC + WebSocket APIs for any
  frontend; the engine itself stays API-agnostic via an in-process event
  bus.
- **Priority tracking.** Talkgroup preemption based on user-defined
  priority levels; multi-site neighbor following.

## 🛠 Tech stack

- **Language:** Go 1.24+
- **Hardware:** `libusb-1.0` + `librtlsdr` via CGO (custom thin binding)
- **DSP:** `gonum/dsp/fourier` for FFT, custom polyphase channelizer,
  filters, and demodulators
- **Logging:** `log/slog` (stdlib)
- **API (planned):** gRPC + Protobuf for metadata; server-streaming RPC
  for audio; WebSocket bridge for browser frontends

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

```sh
sudo apt-get install librtlsdr-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev
```

See [`docs/hardware.md`](docs/hardware.md) for `udev` rules and DVB
blacklisting on Linux.

### Build and test

```sh
make build     # produces ./bin/gophertrunk
make test      # go test -race ./...
make vet
```

### Smoke test

```sh
./bin/gophertrunk version
./bin/gophertrunk sdr list      # enumerates attached RTL-SDR dongles
./bin/gophertrunk run --config config.yaml
```

A minimal `config.yaml`:

```yaml
log:
  level: info
  format: text
sdr:
  sample_rate: 2400000
  devices:
    - serial: "00000001"
      role: control
      ppm: -2
trunking:
  systems:
    - name: ExampleP25
      protocol: p25
      control_channels: [851000000, 852000000]
```

## Contributing

The project is being built phase by phase per
[`docs/phases.md`](docs/phases.md). Each phase is independently buildable
and testable. PRs that complete deferred items in earlier phases (the
"deferred" lists in `docs/phases.md`) are very welcome — the most useful
near-term targets are the BCH + P25 trellis tables (so the P25 control
channel decodes live IQ end-to-end) and the demod-pipeline composer that
glues SDR → channelizer → demod → control-channel state machine.
