# GopherTrunk 📻🐹

A headless, low-latency digital-trunking scanner engine in Go.

GopherTrunk manages a pool of RTL-SDR dongles, runs a custom Go DSP
pipeline, decodes the signalling layers of every major trunked-radio
family (P25 Phase 1 / Phase 2, DMR Tier III, NXDN, Motorola Type II /
SmartZone, EDACS / GE-Marc, LTR, MPT 1327, dPMR Mode 3, TETRA TMO)
plus the D-STAR amateur repeater header, follows voice grants by
talkgroup priority, and streams metadata + audio to any frontend over
gRPC, HTTP/SSE, or WebSocket.

| Demod pipeline    | `internal/voice/composer` subscribes to `CallStart` events, opens the bound Voice device's IQ stream, runs an LPF → decimate → optional CMA equalizer → FM demod → decimate → int16 PCM chain into the recorder, and pings `Engine.Touch` every second so the silent-call watchdog leaves the call alone |
| Simulcast / "True I/Q" | `internal/dsp/equalizer` (LMS + CMA blind equalizers) for inter-symbol-interference / multipath mitigation, plus `internal/dsp/diversity` (Selection + maximal-ratio combiners over a shared `Combiner` interface) for multi-receiver IQ combining |
| Tone-out alerting | `internal/voice/toneout` runs Goertzel filters against each Voice device's PCM stream, matches QC-II two-tone-sequential sequences against operator-configured profiles with per-tone duration + cooldown, and publishes `tone.alert` events that fan out through SSE / WebSocket / gRPC |

| Persistence       | Pure-Go SQLite (`modernc.org/sqlite`) call log subscribing to `CallStart` / `CallEnd` events; newest-first history queries with system / group / time filters; retention sweeper that ages out DB rows and recorded `.wav` / `.raw` files past configurable cutoffs |
| Observability     | Prometheus collector (events / calls / CC-locked / IQ-underrun / USB-reconnect / decode-error / SDR-attached / build-info series) exposed at `/metrics`; multi-stage `Dockerfile`; `docker-compose.yml` with RTL-SDR USB pass-through, healthcheck, and Prometheus scrape labels |
| Daemon            | `cmd/gophertrunk run` composes everything above into a single supervised process with signal-driven shutdown; every component is opt-in via `config.yaml` |
| Testing           | Per-package unit tests under `make test`; `make integration` boots the wired daemon end-to-end (no SDR), publishes a synthetic call on the bus, and asserts the engine + recorder + call log + metrics + API agree — runs on every CI build |

## Status & known gaps

End-to-end audio works today for **analog FM voice channels**: the
control channel locks, the engine allocates a Voice device on a
grant, the composer pulls IQ → PCM → WAV, and the call is logged to
SQLite. The honest gaps:

- **Live P25 control-channel decoding** still needs the
  TIA-102.BAAA-A trellis tables and the TSBK block interleaver
  before the existing TSBK parser receives real data. BCH(63,16,11)
  for the NID is also stubbed.
- **DMR Tier II** is mostly a configuration variation on the Tier
  III scaffolding that's already in place; both share the burst,
  slot-type, and BPTC pieces.
- **DMR slot-type** still wants the Hamming(20,8) over the 20-bit
  field; **NXDN** wants the SACCH FEC + sub-frame interleaver.
- **Digital voice** (P25 Phase 1 IMBE; AMBE+2 for P25 Phase 2 / DMR
  / NXDN) is gated on the vocoders. The `Vocoder` plugin interface
  + raw-frame sidecar are in place; pure-Go IMBE is in progress
  ([patents have expired](docs/vocoders.md)) and AMBE+2 stays
  behind the `mbelib` build tag.
- **Higher-fidelity audio**: the FM chain currently does naive
  decimation rather than proper polyphase resampling, and skips
  de-emphasis + post-demod LPF + AGC. Quality is good enough to
  verify wiring; real DSP polish is follow-up work.

The Go interfaces and event payloads carry digital protocols already,
so dropping in a band-plan resolver and IMBE will light up the
remaining paths without further changes elsewhere.

## Roadmap

What's still on the table. Order isn't fixed; each item is contained
to its own package and lands independently.

- **Pure-Go IMBE vocoder.** A native-Go IMBE 4400 bps decoder for
  default builds without a CGO dependency. Core US patents are
  expired; the algorithm is implementable from TIA-102.BABA. The
  `mbelib` build-tagged path already covers IMBE for operators with
  libmbe installed.
- **DVSI USB-3000 / AMBE-3003 hardware backend.** A `Vocoder`
  factory that opens a connected DVSI USB chip. Same plug-in shape
  as `internal/voice/mbelib`; the daemon picks the factory by name
  from `voice.DefaultRegistry`.
- **ProVoice raw-frame export.** The EDACS package already flags
  ProVoice grants. Wire the recorder so ProVoice calls produce a
  `.raw` frame sidecar that researchers can decode out-of-band —
  patent + trade-secret encumbrance makes a built-in decoder
  impractical.
- **Yaesu System Fusion (C4FM, FICH).** Amateur-radio digital mode,
  public spec. New `internal/radio/ysf/` package following the
  D-STAR pattern: header parser + repeater state machine.
- **Higher-fidelity FM voice chain.** The composer's per-call FM
  chain currently does naive decimation rather than proper
  polyphase resampling, and skips de-emphasis + post-demod LPF +
  AGC. Quality is good enough to verify wiring; this is real DSP
  polish for production audio.
- **Live-CC bring-up FEC pieces.** P25 Phase 1 trellis tables +
  TSBK block interleaver, BCH(63,16,11) for the NID, DMR slot-type
  Hamming(20,8), NXDN SACCH FEC + sub-frame interleaver. Each is a
  contained primitive in `internal/radio/framing/`; the protocol
  parsers above already consume the corrected bits.

## Tech stack

  filters, and demodulators

| Windows 11 | `gophertrunk-<ver>-windows-amd64.zip`                  | Portable ZIP — same files, no installer                  |
| Linux      | `gophertrunk-<ver>-linux-amd64.tar.gz`                 | Tarballed binary + sample config                         |

Windows users: after running the installer, follow
[`docs/install-windows.md`](docs/install-windows.md) to swap the
RTL-SDR driver to WinUSB via Zadig — the OS won't see your dongle
until that's done. The installer's last page links there too.

### Build from source

### Prerequisites

```sh
sudo apt-get install librtlsdr-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev
```

See [`docs/hardware.md`](docs/hardware.md) for `udev` rules and DVB
blacklisting on Linux.

### Build, test, run

```sh
make build         # produces ./bin/gophertrunk
make test          # go test -race ./...
make integration   # boots the wired daemon end-to-end (no SDR needed)

./bin/gophertrunk version
./bin/gophertrunk sdr list                # enumerates attached dongles
./bin/gophertrunk run -config config.yaml
```

A starter [`config.example.yaml`](config.example.yaml) is in the
repo root — copy it, set the `serial` of your dongle from
`gophertrunk sdr list`, point `talkgroup_file` at a
Trunk-Recorder-format CSV, and you're going.

### Docker

```sh
docker compose up -d
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health
curl -s http://localhost:8080/metrics | grep gophertrunk_build_info
```

[`docs/hardening.md`](docs/hardening.md) has the full operator
playbook — Prometheus catalogue, USB pass-through recipe, smoke
tests.
