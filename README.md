# GopherTrunk 📻🐹

A headless, low-latency digital-trunking scanner engine in Go.

GopherTrunk manages a pool of RTL-SDR dongles, runs a custom Go DSP
pipeline, decodes the signalling layers of every major trunked-radio
family (P25 Phase 1 / Phase 2, DMR Tier II / III, NXDN, Motorola Type II /
SmartZone, EDACS / GE-Marc, LTR, MPT 1327, dPMR Mode 3, TETRA TMO)
plus the D-STAR + Yaesu System Fusion amateur modes, follows voice
grants by talkgroup priority, and streams metadata + audio to any
frontend over gRPC, HTTP/SSE, or WebSocket.

| Orchestration     | In-process pub/sub event bus with typed payloads (Grant / CallStart / CallEnd / DecodeError / ToneAlert / etc.) and a typed `events.Stage` enum so protocol packages can't accidentally publish a stage label that drifts from the Prometheus dashboards, `System` model, JSON-on-disk last-known-CC cache, control-channel `Hunter` that retunes the SDR and parks on the first responsive frequency |
| Trunking engine   | Cross-protocol `Grant` payload, Trunk-Recorder-format talkgroup DB (CSV + JSON), priority + preemption (emergency overrides, strict-higher), voice-device pool allocator, central state machine emitting `CallStart` / `CallEnd` events with a watchdog for silent calls |
| Demod pipeline    | `internal/voice/composer` subscribes to `CallStart` events, opens the bound Voice device's IQ stream, runs an LPF → decimate → optional CMA equalizer → FM demod → optional 75/50µs de-emphasis → optional Kaiser audio LPF → optional audio AGC → optional polyphase L/M resample (or naive decimate fallback) → int16 PCM chain into the recorder, and pings `Engine.Touch` every second so the silent-call watchdog leaves the call alone |
| Simulcast / "True I/Q" | `internal/dsp/equalizer` (LMS + CMA blind equalizers) for inter-symbol-interference / multipath mitigation, plus `internal/dsp/diversity` (Selection + maximal-ratio combiners over a shared `Combiner` interface) for multi-receiver IQ combining |
| Tone-out alerting | `internal/voice/toneout` runs Goertzel filters against each Voice device's PCM stream, matches QC-II two-tone-sequential sequences against operator-configured profiles with per-tone duration + cooldown, and publishes `tone.alert` events that fan out through SSE / WebSocket / gRPC |
| Voice recording   | `Vocoder` plugin interface + `NullVocoder` baseline, 16-bit PCM mono WAV writer with patched-length trailers, per-call recorder writing `<system>/<tg>/<UTC>_src<id>.wav` plus an optional raw-frame sidecar so users can BYO decoder; EDACS ProVoice grants always force a `.raw` sidecar (the vocoder is patent + trade-secret encumbered) so researchers can decode out-of-band |
| API               | `proto/*.proto` schemas under repo root; HTTP REST (`/api/v1/{health,version,systems,talkgroups,calls/active,calls/history}`); operator mutations gated behind `api.allow_mutations` (`GET /api/v1/mutations` capability probe; `POST /api/v1/calls/{serial}/end`; `PATCH /api/v1/talkgroups/{id}`; `POST /api/v1/retention/sweep`; `POST /api/v1/devices/{serial}/tone-reset`); Server-Sent Events stream (`/api/v1/events`); WebSocket bridge (`/api/v1/events/ws`); gRPC `SystemService` + `TalkgroupService` + `AudioService` over the same in-process state |
| Persistence       | Pure-Go SQLite (`modernc.org/sqlite`) call log subscribing to `CallStart` / `CallEnd` events; newest-first history queries with system / group / time filters; retention sweeper that ages out DB rows and recorded `.wav` / `.raw` files past configurable cutoffs |
| Observability     | Prometheus collector (events / calls / CC-locked / IQ-underrun / USB-reconnect / decode-error / SDR-attached / build-info series) exposed at `/metrics`; multi-stage `Dockerfile`; `docker-compose.yml` with RTL-SDR USB pass-through, healthcheck, and Prometheus scrape labels |
| Daemon            | `cmd/gophertrunk run` composes everything above into a single supervised process with signal-driven shutdown; every component is opt-in via `config.yaml` |
| Testing           | Per-package unit tests under `make test`; `make integration` boots the wired daemon end-to-end (no SDR), publishes a synthetic call on the bus, and asserts the engine + recorder + call log + metrics + API agree — runs on every CI build |

## Status & known gaps

End-to-end audio works today for **analog FM voice channels**: the
control channel locks, the engine allocates a Voice device on a
grant, the composer pulls IQ → PCM → WAV, and the call is logged to
SQLite. The honest gaps:

- **Digital voice** (P25 Phase 1 IMBE; AMBE+2 for P25 Phase 2 / DMR
  / NXDN) is gated on the vocoders. The `Vocoder` plugin interface
  + raw-frame sidecar are in place; pure-Go IMBE now produces
  intelligible audio end-to-end ([patents have expired](docs/vocoders.md)),
  with operator-tunable AGC + §6.4 overlap-add windowing + §6.2
  spectral enhancement + frame-repeat on bad-frame indicator
  shipped — absolute-level calibration against a known-good
  reference decoder is the only remaining polish item. Pure-Go
  AMBE+2 lives under `internal/voice/ambe2/` and registers the
  `ambe2` name on every default build; `Decode` now produces real
  audio end-to-end via the shared `internal/voice/mbe/` synthesis
  pipeline (49-bit parameter unpack → cross-frame gamma fold →
  `mbe.PredictLog2Ml` → linear M → unvoiced `Unvc` scaling →
  `mbe.EnhanceAmplitudes` → voiced + unvoiced OA synthesis →
  state roll-forward → per-frame AGC). Single-tone synthesis
  (b₁ ∈ [5, 122] ⇒ sinewave at b₁·31.25 Hz with phase carried
  across frames) is wired; dual-tone (b₁ ∈ [128, 163]) still
  routes through silence pending a frequency-pair lookup the
  public spec doesn't document. Remaining polish: calibration
  against a DSD-FME-decoded DMR reference WAV (AGC defaults are
  tuned for IMBE and AMBE+2 quantisation may need a per-frame
  gain tweak). The
  AMBE+2 algorithm carries active patents in some jurisdictions;
  re-implementing it in pure Go does not change that posture —
  see [docs/vocoders.md](docs/vocoders.md).
- **Higher-fidelity audio**: the FM chain now has opt-in 75/50µs
  de-emphasis, a Kaiser-windowed audio LPF, audio AGC, and a
  polyphase L/M audio resampler — the full polish stack ships.
  Defaults stay analog-FM-friendly so digital protocols and
  passthrough callers see no behavior change.

The Go interfaces and event payloads carry digital protocols already,
so the remaining paths light up once IMBE drops in.

## Roadmap

What's still on the table. Order isn't fixed; each item is contained
to its own package and lands independently.

- **Pure-Go IMBE vocoder.** A native-Go IMBE 4400 bps decoder for
  default builds without a CGO dependency. Core US patents are
  expired; the algorithm is implementable from TIA-102.BABA. The
  synthesis half of the pipeline (cross-frame log-amplitude
  prediction, voiced harmonic generator, unvoiced FFT excitation
  + overlap-add window, §6.2 spectral-amplitude enhancement,
  per-frame AGC) lives in `internal/voice/mbe/` so the AMBE+2
  decoder consumes the same primitives via `mbe.SynthState` +
  `mbe.Params`. Status: skeleton + Vocoder interface registered
  as `imbe` (the canonical name; the pure-Go decoder is the sole
  IMBE backend in default builds); per-vector
  channel-coding FEC inverse (Golay(23,12) for u_0..u_3 +
  Hamming(15,11) for u_4..u_6 + no-FEC u_7 passthrough) is in
  (`internal/voice/imbe/channel.go`); the TIA-102.BABA §7.4
  u_0-keyed LCG pseudo-random scrambler is in
  (`internal/voice/imbe/scrambler.go`); full §5.3 / §5.4 / Annex E
  parameter unpack (b_0 → ω₀ + L + K + Vl voicing + Gm PRBA
  gains + Cik spectral coefficients + Tl log-amplitude residuals
  via two inverse DCTs) is in
  (`internal/voice/imbe/params.go` / `tables.go`); §6.1 cross-frame
  log2(Ml) prediction (eqs. 75-77 — γ = 0.65 interpolation of
  prev-frame harmonics at l · ω₀_curr/ω₀_prev positions, DC-bias
  removal, Tl residual addition) is in on a `SynthState` that the
  excitation step extends (`internal/voice/mbe/synth.go`); §6.2
  amplitude prep (log2(Ml) → linear Ml = 2^log2(Ml), the
  R_M0 = Σ Ml² and R_M1 = Σ Ml² · cos(ω₀·l) spectral moments, and
  a voicing-fraction summary that the synthesis combiner consumes)
  is in (`internal/voice/mbe/amps.go`); §6.3 voiced harmonic
  generator (per-harmonic sinusoid at l · ω₀ with linear amp tilt
  M_prev → M_curr + quadratic phase integration of the ω₀ drift,
  dual-frame iteration so voiced↔unvoiced transitions fade in /
  out cleanly) is in (`internal/voice/mbe/synth_voiced.go`,
  `SynthState` extended with `PrevPhase` + `PrevMl`); §6.4 unvoiced
  excitation (256-point FFT spectrum shaping — bins under voiced
  harmonics zeroed, bins under unvoiced harmonics scaled by Ml[l],
  bins outside [1..L] zeroed, conjugate-mirror invariant preserved
  so the IFFT output stays real-valued) is in
  (`internal/voice/mbe/synth_unvoiced.go`); caller supplies the
  noise buffer so unit tests stay deterministic; the §6.4
  overlap-add synthesis window (256-sample periodic Hann × IFFT,
  96-sample tail threaded through `SynthState.PrevUnvoicedTail` so
  frame boundaries are click-free) is in via
  `SynthUnvoicedOverlapAdd`; the §6.2 spectral-amplitude
  enhancement (per-harmonic W_l = (0.96 · num/den)^0.25 clamped to
  [0.5, 1.2] for mid/high-band harmonics + low-band W = 1, followed
  by an energy-preserving rescale that holds R_M0 stable) is in
  (`internal/voice/mbe/enhance.go`); the output gain calibration is
  a per-frame fast-attack / slow-release peak-envelope tracker
  shared with AMBE+2 (target peak 24000, attack 0.4, release 0.02,
  gain clamped to [10, 1e5]) with first-frame seeding,
  freeze-on-silence, and Reset clearing — replaces the prior
  `pcmGain = 4096` magic constant with consistent loudness across
  speech-pause-speech transitions
  (`internal/voice/mbe/agc.go`).
  **`Decode()` emits real audio**: 88 info bits → params →
  §6.1 prediction → linear Ml → §6.2 enhancement → §6.3 voiced
  harmonic sum + §6.4 unvoiced excitation with overlap-add
  additive into one buffer → state roll-forward → per-frame AGC
  → int16 PCM at 8 kHz. Silence-window frames (b_0 ∈ [216, 219])
  still fade the prev unvoiced tail through the overlap region
  before resetting SynthState — no click on the silence
  boundary, and the AGC envelope is preserved across the
  silence so the next non-silent frame applies the same gain.
  Three decoder constructors are exposed: `New()` seeds the
  unvoiced noise source from a fixed default for reproducibility;
  `NewWithSeed(seed)` lets parallel calls + production callers
  spread noise across decoders; `NewWithConfig(seed, mbe.AGCConfig{...})`
  takes the shared `mbe.AGCConfig` (TargetPeak / Attack / Release /
  MinGain / MaxGain / NoiseFloor) so operators can dial level +
  responsiveness for their downstream chain — zero-value fields
  backfill from `mbe.DefaultAGCConfig()` so partial overrides like
  `mbe.AGCConfig{TargetPeak: 16000}` (drop level by ~3 dB) keep the
  rest of the defaults. **Frame-repeat on bad-frame indicator**:
  a bad frame (UnpackParams error from upstream FEC slip)
  following a good frame replays the cached params with M scaled
  by 0.7 per consecutive bad frame; up to 6 consecutive bad
  frames bridge ~120 ms of weak signal before Decode emits silence
  + clears the cache. The repeat path freezes the AGC envelope
  so the attenuation is audible (signals signal degradation).
  **Phase-aware fade-in**: when a bad-streak state clear is
  followed by good frames returning, the next 3 frames run with
  M scaled by `recoveryRampFactors = {0.4, 0.7, 1.0}` and the
  AGC frozen so the listener eases back in over 60 ms rather
  than jumping straight to full amplitude. The §6.3 voiced
  harmonic generator's amplitude tilt 0 → factor·M[l] keeps the
  first sample at exactly 0 regardless of phase coherence, so
  there's no zero-crossing click on resumption.
  **Remaining audio polish**: absolute-level calibration against a
  known-good reference decoder (DSD-FME or OP25 — capture a P25
  Phase 1 voice exchange, decode through both, compare RMS +
  cross-correlation against the reference WAV under
  `internal/voice/imbe/testdata/`); enhancement filter tuning if
  real-world frames show mid-band envelope drift.
- **Pure-Go AMBE+2 vocoder.** A native-Go AMBE+2 2400 bps decoder
  for P25 Phase 2, DMR (Tier II / III), and NXDN voice frames.
  AMBE+2 is the same MBE-family algorithm as IMBE — same 8 kHz /
  20 ms / 160 PCM cadence, same harmonic + unvoiced FFT synthesis
  shape — so the synthesis half reuses `internal/voice/mbe/`
  directly. Only the front half (bit-level unpack from 49
  information bits into `mbe.Params` plus the AMBE+2-specific
  cross-frame gamma) is AMBE+2-specific. The AMBE+2 algorithm
  carries active patents in some jurisdictions; re-implementing
  it in Go does not change that posture
  ([docs/vocoders.md](docs/vocoders.md)). Status: skeleton +
  Vocoder interface registered as `ambe2` on the default build
  (`internal/voice/ambe2/decoder.go`); 49-bit parameter unpack
  is in (`internal/voice/ambe2/params.go`) — bit extraction for
  b₀..b₈, tone-frame detection (b₀ ∈ {0x7E,0x7F}), fundamental
  + L from `AmbePlusLtable[b₀]`, voicing decisions via
  `AmbePlusVuv[b₁][jl]`, gain delta from `AmbePlusDg[b₂]`,
  PRBA24/PRBA58 → Gm → 8-point inverse DCT → Ri → first two
  Cik coefficients per band, HOC tables b₅..b₈ → remaining Cik
  rows, four per-band inverse DCTs producing the Tl[1..L]
  spectral residuals. Codebook tables are auto-generated from
  szechyjs/mbelib's `ambe3600x2400_const.h` under ISC
  (`internal/voice/ambe2/tables.go`,
  `scripts/gen-ambe2-tables.sh`). Synthesis is wired through
  the shared `mbe` pipeline: `Decode()` resolves the absolute
  gamma (gamma_curr = ΔG + 0.5·gamma_prev cached on the
  Decoder), folds gamma + DC removal + 0.5·log2(L) into Tl so
  the shared `mbe.PredictLog2Ml` produces AMBE+2-spec
  log-amplitudes, applies the AMBE+2 unvoiced `Unvc` scaling
  (0.2046/√ω₀) between log2Ml→Ml and the §6.2 enhancement,
  then runs `mbe.SynthVoiced` + `mbe.SynthUnvoicedOverlapAdd`
  + state roll-forward + per-frame AGC into int16 PCM. Tone
  frames (b₀ ∈ {0x7E, 0x7F}) decode b₁/b₂ via the
  AMBE+2-specific bit layout (t5/t6/t7 table lookup on
  info[6,7,8] feeding bits 5..7 of b₁); valid single-tone
  indices (b₁ ∈ [5, 122]) synthesise a sinewave at b₁·31.25 Hz
  scaled by b₂, with oscillator phase carried across frames in
  the Decoder so a held tone is click-free. Dual-tone
  (b₁ ∈ [128, 163]) and invalid tone indices route through the
  §6.4 OA fade-out + state reset. Bad-frame replay uses the
  shared `mbe.MaxBadFrames` / `mbe.BadFrameAttenuation`.
  **Remaining polish**: calibration against a DSD-FME-decoded
  DMR reference recording (testdata follow-up); dual-tone
  synthesis once a frequency-pair lookup is sourced.
- **DVSI USB-3000 / AMBE-3003 hardware backend.** A `Vocoder`
  factory that opens a connected DVSI USB chip. Same plug-in shape
  as `internal/voice/ambe2`; the daemon picks the factory by name
  from `voice.DefaultRegistry`.
- **YSF Trellis decode + grant emission.** Sync, frame layout, and
  the post-FEC FICH bit-level parser are in; what's left is the
  K=5 ½-rate Viterbi Trellis decoder over the on-air 100-bit FICH
  region and the control-channel wiring that publishes
  `protocol = "ysf"` grants on the bus when a Header FICH lands.
- **Higher-fidelity FM voice chain.** ✅ Shipped: opt-in 75/50µs
  de-emphasis (`composer.DeEmphasisConfig`), Kaiser-windowed audio
  LPF (`composer.AudioLPFConfig`), audio AGC
  (`composer.AudioAGCConfig`), and polyphase L/M audio resampler
  (`composer.AudioResamplerConfig`).

### Build from source

### Prerequisites

```sh
sudo apt-get install librtlsdr-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev
```

See [`docs/hardware.md`](docs/hardware.md) for `udev` rules and DVB
blacklisting on Linux.

### Build, test, run

```sh

Eight panels covering every read surface, vim-style navigation, live
SSE event stream, periodic REST refresh, automatic reconnect on
disconnect:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | next / previous panel |
| `1`–`8` | jump to Dashboard / Systems / Talkgroups / Active / History / Events / Tones / Metrics |
| `j` / `k` | move row up / down inside a table |
| `/` | filter (Talkgroups, Events) |
| `s` | cycle sort (Talkgroups) |
| `p` | pause auto-scroll (Events) |
| `r` | reload (History) |
| `?` | toggle help |
| `q` / `Ctrl+C` | quit |

For mutation actions (end-call, set-priority, lockout,
retention-sweep, tone-detector reset) start the daemon with
`api.allow_mutations: true` and the TUI with `--write`. Both ends
gate independently because the HTTP API has no authentication.
