// boundaryTracker is the protocol-agnostic recording-boundary controller
// shared by every voice chain (FM, DMR, P25 Phase 1 / 2). It centralises
// the universal call-boundary behaviour so hangtime + split/conversation
// grouping work identically across protocols:
//
//   - Hangtime end-of-call: once voice has been decoding, the call is
//     ended VoiceHangtime after the last decoded voice frame, instead of
//     waiting out the engine's much longer call-timeout watchdog. This
//     keeps recordings tightly bounded to the actual transmission.
//   - Talkgroup gating (digital protocols that decode an in-band TG):
//     audio whose talkgroup differs from the granted talkgroup is not
//     written, and a sustained foreign talkgroup ends the call — fixing
//     the shared-frequency case where two virtual tuners decode the same
//     IQ and one call would otherwise append the other talkgroup's audio.
//   - Per-transmission splitting: at an end-of-transmission boundary
//     (a P25 terminator, a DMR voice terminator, an FM squelch gap, …)
//     the recorder rolls to a fresh file when split mode is on.
//
// A chain feeds the tracker two facts — onVoice(tg) per decoded voice
// frame and onTransmissionEnd() at an over boundary — and runs run(ctx)
// in a goroutine. Everything else (Touch throttling, EndCall, segment
// publishing) is handled here so the chains stay thin and uniform.
//
// Concurrency: onVoice / onTransmissionEnd are called from the single
// chain goroutine; run executes in its own goroutine and only reads the
// atomics. The mutable match/segment bookkeeping is touched only by the
// chain goroutine.
