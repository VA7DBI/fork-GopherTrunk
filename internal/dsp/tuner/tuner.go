// Package tuner extracts narrow-band baseband IQ for one or more frequency
// offsets from a single wide-band SDR IQ stream. It is the building block
// that lets one physical SDR feed several protocol receivers tuned to
// different repeater carriers within the dongle's IQ bandwidth.
//
// A Bank owns the wide-band-to-narrow-band conversion and dispatches the
// resulting per-offset IQ chunks to registered sinks. Two implementations
// are provided:
//
//   - DDCBank: one independent complex-NCO mixer + rational polyphase
//     resampler per tap. Cost scales linearly with the number of taps but
//     there is no constraint on the tap offsets - they can sit anywhere
//     inside the dongle's usable IQ band. Best for a small number of taps.
//
//   - ChannelizerBank: a single M-channel critically-sampled polyphase
//     channelizer (internal/dsp/channelizer) splits the input into evenly-
//     spaced bins; a small fine-tune DDC on the bin nearest each tap
//     offset cleans up the residual. The wide-band filter cost is shared
//     across all taps, which wins at higher tap counts.
//
// Both implementations decimate to the same narrow-band rate - typically
// 48 kHz, matching what the existing 4800-baud C4FM receivers
// (DMR / P25 / NXDN / dPMR / YSF / D-STAR) are matched-filter-tuned for.
