// Package ccdecoder is the connector that closes the IQ → control-
// channel decoder gap listed in the README "Status & known gaps".
//
// What this package does:
//
//   - Owns the control SDR's IQ stream (one StreamIQ loop per
//     Decoder lifetime).
//   - Subscribes to events.KindHuntProgress so it learns which
//     system / frequency the CC Hunter supervisor is currently
//     attempting.
//   - On every HuntProgress transition, swaps the active per-
//     protocol pipeline (IQ → symbol-domain decoder → CC state
//     machine) via the package-local factory map keyed on
//     trunking.Protocol.
//   - Down-converts every raw IQ chunk to a narrowband channel
//     stream — rational polyphase decimation, ~48 kHz for the
//     4800-baud C4FM family, wider for TETRA — before the pipeline
//     sees it. The per-protocol receivers size their matched
//     filters for this channelized rate, not the raw SDR rate, so
//     this stage is what lets a live 2.048 MHz RTL-SDR stream
//     actually lock (issue #275).
//   - Pumps every down-converted IQ chunk through the active
//     pipeline's Process method. The pipeline's CC state machine
//     publishes events.KindCCLocked / events.KindGrant on the same
//     bus, which the supervisor + engine consume to drive the rest
//     of the daemon.
//
// What this package does NOT do:
//
//   - It doesn't retune the SDR — that's the CC Hunter
//     supervisor's job (`internal/scanner/cchunt`). The Decoder
//     follows the supervisor's lead via HuntProgress events.
//   - It doesn't open / close the SDR device — the daemon does
//     that and hands a Tuner + IQSource through Options.
//   - It doesn't decode every protocol from day one. Each
//     pipeline is gated on having a control-channel state
//     machine that accepts a raw dibit / bit stream. Protocols
//     whose CC state machine still consumes pre-parsed PDUs
//     (DMR / NXDN / dPMR / EDACS / MPT 1327 / LTR / Motorola /
//     P25 P2 / TETRA) need a Process(...) adapter on their
//     control package first — a documented follow-up per the
//     per-protocol receiver PRs that already shipped.
