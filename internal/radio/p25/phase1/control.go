// ControlChannel consumes a stream of P25 Phase 1 dibits (already
// symbol-time-recovered and mapped via SymbolToDibit) and emits
// trunking events onto an events.Bus.
//
// Pipeline: dibit window → FSW detect → NID parse (BCH(63,16,11) +
// even-parity check) → if DUID is TSDU and the buffer holds enough
// dibits, deinterleave + Viterbi-decode the next 98-dibit TSBK block,
// validate the CRC trailer, and dispatch on the parsed opcode.
//
//   - OpIdentifierUpdate (0x3D) and OpIdentifierUpdateVUHF (0x34)
//     populate the band-plan slot for their Channel ID; 0x3D carries
//     the 700/800/900 MHz packing, 0x34 carries the VHF/UHF packing.
//   - OpGroupVoiceChannelGrant (0x00) parses the channel/group/source
//     payload, looks up the frequency in the band plan, and publishes
//     a trunking.Grant with Protocol="p25" on the bus.
//
// CCLocked / CCLost events fan out on the first corrected NID with a
// TSDU DUID. Uncorrectable NIDs and TSBK CRC failures publish
// KindDecodeError; a grant whose Channel ID has no IdentifierUpdate
// yet publishes KindDecodeError with stage="no-bandplan" so the
// metric counter surfaces the gap.
