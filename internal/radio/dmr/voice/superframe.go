// Decoder extracts DMR voice superframes from a dibit stream. It is
// the voice-burst counterpart of the tier2 / tier3 control-channel
// Process adapters: those slice a burst on every sync match, but
// voice bursts B–F carry no sync, so the Decoder locks onto burst A
// via its voice sync word and slices B–F at a fixed TDMA cadence.
//
// stride is the number of physical 132-dibit bursts between two
// consecutive bursts of the SAME logical call:
//
//   - stride 1 — a single-slot / direct stream where a call's bursts
//     A–F are contiguous (132-dibit cadence). This is NewDecoder and
//     matches synthetic single-slot vectors.
//   - stride 2 — a real 2-slot TDMA carrier (NewInterleavedDecoder),
//     where the other timeslot's burst sits between each of a call's
//     bursts, so same-slot bursts are 264 dibits apart. One such
//     Decoder transparently emits superframes for BOTH slots: it locks
//     each slot's burst A on its own voice sync and gathers that slot's
//     B–F by striding over the interleaved burst. The two slots' output
//     is told apart by VoiceSuperframe.Phase.
//
// A Decoder is stateful and not safe for concurrent use; construct
// one per voice-call decode chain.
