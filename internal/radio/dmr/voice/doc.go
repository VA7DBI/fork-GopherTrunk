// Package voice decodes the DMR voice path: it recognises voice
// superframes in a dibit stream and extracts the AMBE+2 frames they
// carry.
//
// DMR voice is organised into 6-burst superframes (bursts A–F, 360 ms
// of audio). Burst A is framed by a voice sync word (BS/MS/DM Voice);
// bursts B–F replace the sync word with embedded signalling, so they
// carry no sync of their own and must be located by the TDMA cadence
// relative to burst A. Each burst carries 216 voice bits — three
// 72-bit on-air AMBE+2 frames — for 18 frames per superframe.
//
// DMR is 2-slot TDMA, so a carrier interleaves two independent calls.
// The Decoder's stride controls the cadence between a call's own
// consecutive bursts: NewDecoder (stride 1) expects a single-slot
// stream with contiguous 132-dibit bursts; NewInterleavedDecoder
// (stride 2) handles a real 2-slot carrier, gathering each slot's
// bursts 264 dibits apart and emitting one superframe per slot, told
// apart by VoiceSuperframe.Phase.
//
// Alongside the AMBE frames, the decoder reassembles the embedded Link
// Control carried by the sync field of bursts B–E (EMB + four BPTC
// fragments → framing.DecodeEmbeddedLC → dmr.FLC) and, when it passes
// its CRC, exposes the call's talkgroup + source on
// VoiceSuperframe.LC. Combined with Phase, that lets a consumer label
// which timeslot a superframe belongs to (the BS-sourced burst-A sync
// is identical on both slots and cannot).
//
// This package produces the *on-air* AMBE frames (72 bits each, FEC
// still applied). Decoding the AMBE forward-error-correction down to
// the 49-bit vocoder payload, the ARC4 descramble for encrypted
// traffic, and wiring the decoder into the per-call composer/recorder
// all layer on top — see issue #276.
