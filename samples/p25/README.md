# P25 Phase 1 captures (demod-quality measurement)

Drop **P25 Phase 1** control-channel IQ recordings here to feed the
demodulator measurement harness
([`internal/radio/p25/phase1/metrics`](../../internal/radio/p25/phase1/metrics/)).
The synthetic sweep
([`internal/radio/p25/phase1/receiver/sweep_test.go`](../../internal/radio/p25/phase1/receiver/sweep_test.go))
benchmarks the demod against the theoretical limit; a capture dropped here is
the **field truth** — it runs the real signal through the receiver and reports
the pre-FEC error rate, EVM, estimated SNR, and FSW sync-margin so a weak-decode
report becomes a number you can act on.

Two captures are most valuable, and you can drop either or both:

- a **C4FM** site (the FM-discriminator path — the one the harness shows is the
  most noise-fragile), and
- an **LSM / CQPSK simulcast** site (the linear path).

## Capture format

| Property | Expected value |
| --- | --- |
| File format | Complex float32 IQ (`*.cfile`, GNU Radio interleaved little-endian) |
| Sample rate | Any rate ≥ 48 kHz; channelise to 48 kHz nominal so it decodes standalone |
| Modulation | C4FM (4-level FSK, 4800 sym/s) **or** LSM/CQPSK (π/4-DQPSK) |
| Centre | Tuned on the control-channel carrier (small DC offset OK; the AFC re-tunes) |
| Duration | ≥ 1 second — enough for several FSW+NID+TSBK frames |

Keep it small enough to commit (a ~1 s 48 kHz slice is ~400 KB), like the
existing `cmd/gophertrunk/testdata/mmr-s9-cc.cfile` regression fixture.

## Metadata schema

Alongside each `*.cfile`, place a `*.metadata.json`:

```json
{
  "source": "RTL-SDR @ <site>, channelised to 48 kHz",
  "tool_cross_check": "OP25 / DSD-FME (optional, for the cross-check)",
  "sample_rate_hz": 48000,
  "center_freq_hz": 420050000,
  "expected": {
    "demod_mode": "c4fm",
    "nac": "0x167",
    "min_nid_trusted": 8,
    "min_tsbk": 24,
    "max_evm_pct": 30.0,
    "min_snr_db": 12.0,
    "min_sync_margin": 2
  },
  "notes": "Optional: capture conditions, antenna, observed RF SNR, etc."
}
```

- `demod_mode` selects the receiver path: `"c4fm"` (default) or `"cqpsk"`.
- `nac` (hex) is asserted against the locked NAC when present.
- `min_nid_trusted` / `min_tsbk` are decode-yield floors (see the
  `mmr-s9-cc.cfile` regression test for the shape).
- `max_evm_pct` / `min_snr_db` / `min_sync_margin` are the **demod-quality**
  bounds the harness grades — leave them out to only *report* the metrics
  without asserting. As the demod improves, tighten them (they are floors,
  not targets).

The metrics are always logged by
`TestReplayP25RealCaptureMetrics`
([`cmd/gophertrunk/p25_realcapture_metrics_test.go`](../../cmd/gophertrunk/p25_realcapture_metrics_test.go));
the bounds above turn the log lines into a pass/fail gate. With no capture
present the test skips.
