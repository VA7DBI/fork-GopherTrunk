## [Unreleased]

## [v0.2.5] — 2026-05-28

Issue #376 follow-up (Motorola MMR P25 talker alias) closes end-to-end +
Phase-5 (APRS) goes live + issue #402 (RTL-SDR DC-spike on P25 control)
three-phase investigation. The Motorola MMR talker-alias path now lands:
#397 ports Motorola's vendor LCO 0x15 / 0x17 form for Phase 1 voice
channels (the standard TIA-102.AABF form #389 implemented doesn't match
what real MMR systems emit), #403 dispatches MAC PDUs on the Phase 2
voice chain so MMR Phase 2 talker-alias decodes too, and #409 backfills
source RID + ALGID / KID encryption from the voice channel by parsing
`GROUP_VOICE_CHANNEL_USER_ABBREVIATED` (opcode 0x01, previously
mis-named `OpMACPTT` and silently discarded). APRS reaches end-to-end
live: #401 adds the HDLC framer + receiver glue, #411 wires the
Bell-202 AFSK DSP frontend (IQ → FM → real resample → tone
discriminator → Mueller-Müller timing → NRZI → HDLC → AX.25 + APRS
info-field → events bus), so configuring `aprs.channels` with a serial
+ frequency lights up the bus, SQLite log, REST endpoint, and `/aprs`
web panel from #384 / #390. Issue #402 (RTL-SDR DC-spike pulls the
P25 control-channel offset estimator into the spike) lands in three
slices: #406 adds CCStats + per-sample recording-power diagnostics,
#408 mirrors the replay path through the production DDC and adds
state-evolution diagnostics, and #412 swaps in a decision-directed AFC
that defeats data-DC integration. Plus: #399 makes the P25 Phase 1
voice composer honour `trunking.systems[].p25_phase1_demod_mode` so
simulcast / LSM grants don't silently fail on FM-discriminator
hardcode; #398 widens the Windows RTL-SDR cold-boot recovery envelope
to 5 attempts with 200 / 400 / 800 / 1200 ms backoff and 150 ms
WinUSB settle (issue #395); #400 surfaces two silent-degradation
paths at startup (no `gain:` configured per SDR, conventional tone
gating with zero `sdr.sample_rate`); #413 routes Phase 1 TDMA-channel
grants to the Phase 2 voice chain; #407 promotes Motorola patch
member talkgroups over the super-group in CC Activity (issue #405);
and #396 adds a Markdown blog with per-category archives, RSS, and
SEO meta to the Pages site.

### Added

- **APRS DSP frontend — pipeline is now end-to-end.** Fifth and
  load-bearing slice of Phase 5 (#365 plan): the
  `internal/radio/aprs/afsk` package wires an `afsk.Receiver`
  per configured APRS channel between the iqtap broker and the
  bit-stream orchestrator that shipped in #401. Pipeline: IQ →
  `demod.FM` → real resampler down to 9600 sps → `demod.FFSK`
  tone discriminator (mark 1200 Hz, space 2200 Hz) → Mueller-
  Müller symbol-timing recovery → DC-tracking slicer → NRZI
  decode → HDLC framer → AX.25 + APRS info-field parse →
  `events.KindAPRSPacket`. New top-level `aprs.channels` config
  schema (`internal/config.APRSChannelConfig`, mirroring
  `paging.pocsag`); daemon constructs one receiver per entry,
  subscribes each to its SDR's iqtap broker via the standard
  spawn closure. `Stats()` surfaces IQ-samples-seen + bits-
  emitted; the bit-stream layer's frame counters remain reachable
  via `Inner().Stats()`. Operators add an entry like
  `serial: antenna-pi, frequency_hz: 144_390_000` and packets
  start landing on the bus, the `aprs_log` SQLite table,
  `/api/v1/aprs/packets`, and the `/aprs` web panel.
  Tests cover NRZI round-trip (transition / no-transition
  polarity, clamping, reset), receiver option validation,
  Process ctx-cancel + nil-input + clean-close, and stats
  counter accumulation. The synthetic IQ end-to-end test is
  currently `t.Skip`-ped pending a captured `samples/aprs/`
  fixture (same posture as POCSAG #378 — the receiver code is
  exercised by the unit-level coverage above and the orchestrator
  tests from #401).
- **P25 Phase 2 traffic-channel metadata backfill (issue #376
  follow-up).** Resolves the symptoms surfaced by @er-imagery's
  2026-05-28 MMR field test: Phase 2 grants on encrypted
  talkgroups arrived with `src=0` + `enc=false`, ALGID/KID never
  populated, and `composer: p25p2 talker alias` log lines never
  fired — even after #403 wired alias dispatch into the voice
  chain. Root cause: the MAC opcode constant `OpMACPTT = 0x01`
  was a fictional name; the real TIA-102 / SDRTrunk opcode at
  0x01 is `GROUP_VOICE_CHANNEL_USER_ABBREVIATED`, the in-call
  broadcast that carries SOURCE_ID + SVC_OPTIONS on the traffic
  channel during an active call. Real MMR PDUs at 0x01 were
  being parsed as "MAC PTT" and discarded.
  - `phase2.OpMACPTT` is removed and replaced by
    `phase2.OpGroupVoiceChannelUserAbbreviated = 0x01`. New
    `OpGroupVoiceChannelUserExtended = 0x21` covers the SUID-
    extended variant.
  - New `phase2.GroupVoiceChannelUser` struct +
    `MACPDU.AsGroupVoiceChannelUser()` accessor parses the
    SDRTrunk-confirmed layout: SVC_OPTIONS at payload[0],
    GROUP_ADDRESS at payload[1..2], SOURCE_ADDRESS at
    payload[3..5].
  - New `events.KindCallSourceUpdate` event +
    `trunking.CallSourceUpdate` payload + `VoicePool.UpdateSource`
    method + `Engine.handleCallSourceUpdate` handler form the
    backfill path: composer publishes, engine patches
    `ActiveCall.Grant.SourceID/.Encrypted`, republishes with the
    call's identity. `AffiliationTracker` subscribes so RID
    chips populate from the backfilled source.
  - The voice composer's Phase 2 chain now also dispatches
    in-call `OpEncryptionSync` (existing parser, just hooked up)
    via the existing `KindCallEncryption` event, mirroring the
    Phase 1 LDU2 path. ALGID/KID flow onto the active call as
    the EncryptionSync PDU arrives.
  - Diagnostic safety net: one Info log line per (opcode, MFID)
    per call —
    `composer: p25p2 mac pdu system=… serial=… opcode=… mfid=…
    payload_len=…` — so if MMR emits a vendor opcode we still
    don't dispatch (e.g. a different talker-alias opcode), the
    next field test pinpoints exactly what we saw.
  - Pre-existing `phase2.OpGroupVoiceChannelUserExt = 0x46` is
    renamed to `OpUnitToUnitGrantUpdateAbbreviated` to match
    its actual TIA-102 / SDRTrunk identity. No parser was
    wired to it; the rename is name-only.
- **P25 Phase 2 voice-channel talker-alias decode.** Resolves the
  follow-up half of #376: on Motorola MMR (and any Phase 2 system
  whose CC never emits talker-alias PDUs), display names ride MAC
  sub-frames that interleave with voice sub-frames on the traffic
  channel. The voice composer's Phase 2 chain now runs the same
  MAC-PDU dispatch the CC does — refactored into the new exported
  `phase2.DecodeSuperframeMACPDUs` — and publishes
  `events.KindTalkerAlias` when a fragment sequence completes. The
  CC's per-channel FEC config (trellis / RS / interleave /
  scrambler mode + 44-bit PN44 seed) rides on the published Grant
  via a new `trunking.P25Phase2Decode` field so the composer can
  decode MAC PDUs without owning a CC reference. Field-reporter
  re-test on MMR is the real verifier; #397's Phase 1
  Motorola-form path is unchanged.
- **APRS HDLC framer + receiver.** Fourth slice of Phase 5 (#365).
  `internal/radio/aprs/hdlc` is the bit-stream → frame-bytes
  layer: sliding-flag detector with bit-stuffing reversal,
  shared-flag packing tolerance, and 7+-ones abort sequence
  handling. `internal/radio/aprs/receiver` is the orchestrator
  that threads bits through the framer, parses each emitted
  frame with `ax25.Parse`, decodes the info field with
  `aprs.Decode`, and publishes one `events.KindAPRSPacket` per
  successfully-decoded UI frame. The bus payload is a
  `storage.APRSPacket` carrying the AX.25 envelope + APRS
  sub-type label + summary + (for position-bearing types)
  lat/lon, so the SQLite log + REST endpoint + `/aprs` web
  panel from #384 light up the moment a DSP layer pushes wire
  bits at `receiver.Push`. `DropBadFCS` / `DropNonUI` opt-ins;
  in/parsed/CRC-failed/emitted counters for future `/metrics`.
  See [docs/aprs.md](docs/aprs.md).

### Fixed

- **P25 Phase 1 voice chain now honours `p25_phase1_demod_mode`
  (issue #356 follow-up, reporter @v2maldo).** The per-call P25
  Phase 1 voice receiver was hardcoded to the C4FM
  FM-discriminator path regardless of the system-level
  `trunking.systems[].p25_phase1_demod_mode` setting. On a
  simulcast / LSM site the control channel decoded fine (the
  ccdecoder connector already honoured the setting) but every
  voice grant landed in an FM-discriminator that couldn't sync on
  LSM-modulated dibits — the LDU sink never fired, the
  frame-activity counter from #356's earlier fix never advanced,
  and the watchdog reaped the call at `call_timeout_ms` with an
  empty WAV. The mode string is now plumbed through
  `trunking.Grant` and the voice composer passes it into
  `p25p1rx.Options.DemodMode`. Empty / unrecognised values warn-log
  and fall back to C4FM so a typo doesn't silently kill a
  previously-working system.
- **RTL-SDR cold-boot stall on Windows: wider recovery envelope for the
  most stubborn clone dongles (issue #395).** A Windows 10 reporter on
  v0.2.4 still hit `rtlsdr: init baseband: init baseband step 0 ...
  ERROR_GEN_FAILURE` after the prior #382 + #393 fixes — warmup succeeded
  but the byte-identical step 0 of `InitBaseband` failed, and all three
  attempts of the previous 3-attempt / 100 ms+200 ms backoff envelope
  also failed. The open-time bring-up envelope now runs 5 attempts (4
  resets) with exponential backoff (200 / 400 / 800 / 1200 ms), and the
  WinUSB `Reset()` settle grows from 50 ms to 150 ms — both targeted at
  Windows USB-stack timing for the wedged-firmware recovery path.
  Healthy dongles still open on attempt 0 with zero delay; only dongles
  that actually need recovery pay the new costs. The surfaced hint for
  `ErrPipeStalled` now also recommends unplugging the dongle for 10 s
  before re-plugging (which physically clears the firmware state) and
  references the issue for users hitting this after a Windows
  sleep/resume.

### Changed

- **Operator-visible warnings for two silent-degradation paths
  surfaced by issue #356 triage.** Both fix observability gaps
  rather than behaviour, so a working config keeps working but a
  misconfigured one now logs a single line at startup pointing
  the operator at the fix.
  - `sdr: no gain configured for device ... use \`gain: auto\` for
    AGC or a specific tenth-dB value` — fires once per device that
    has a `sdr.devices[]` entry but no `gain:` key. The librtlsdr
    default isn't safe across every tuner / antenna / LNA chain;
    on some clones it leaves the SDR deaf and the symptom looks
    like a broken voice chain. See [docs/hardware.md](docs/hardware.md).
  - `conv: tone gating configured but scanner sample rate is zero;
    tone gate disabled` — fires when a conventional-scanner channel
    has `tone.mode: ctcss` or `dcs` but `sdr.sample_rate` is
    unset. The channel previously appeared in scan rotation with
    the gate silently bypassed (every signal passing), with no log
    explaining why CTCSS / DCS wasn't engaging.
- **Motorola voice-channel talker-alias decoder (issue #376
  follow-up).** Field-testing on a real MMR system surfaced that
  the standard TIA-102.AABF HEADER + BLOCK1 + BLOCK2 form #389
  implemented does NOT match what Motorola actually emits — real
  Motorola P25 systems use a vendor-specific variant: LCO 0x15
  header (talkgroup + variable block_count + sequence number) +
  N × LCO 0x17 data blocks (44-bit fragment each), with the
  reassembled message running the encoded alias through a
  proprietary lookup-table + accumulator cipher to recover the
  UTF-16 character stream. Replaced `StandardTalkerAliasBuf`
  with a clean-room Go port of the Motorola form
  (`phase1.MotorolaTalkerAliasBuf` +
  `phase1.decodeAliasBytes`). The voice composer dispatch on
  `IsTalkerAliasLCO` is unchanged at the call site; the Info
  log line now reads "composer: p25p1 motorola talker alias
  src=... alias=..." so operators can see decode events in the
  daemon log. The cipher LUT and arithmetic are treated as
  facts about Motorola's wire protocol (the algorithm is
  reverse-engineered prior art across multiple open-source
  decoders).

## [v0.2.4] — 2026-05-27

Phase-5 (APRS) + Phase-3 (POCSAG) + Phase-1 (Radio IDs) feature-density
follow-up to v0.2.3. The APRS scaffold landed (events bus / SQLite log /
REST / web panel — #384) and immediately got its protocol layer
(pure-Go AX.25 frame parser + APRS info-field decoder — #390), with
the Bell-202 AFSK DSP receiver as the remaining follow-up. POCSAG
closed end-to-end with the DSP receiver + daemon wiring (#378), so a
tuned SDR's IQ now flows demod → bit-slicer → syncer → page event →
SQLite log / REST / web panel without further plumbing. Radio IDs
landed in three slices: the `RIDDB` alias catalogue + REST + gRPC +
`/rids` web panel mirroring `TalkgroupDB` (#387), the standard
TIA-102.AABF P25 voice-channel talker-alias LC decoder (LDU1 LCOs
0x15 / 0x16 / 0x17 — #389) closing the second half of issue #376, and
a docs pass under [docs/radio-ids.md](docs/radio-ids.md). One-dongle
deployments got more powerful: the `role: wideband` channelizer now
hosts P25 Phase 1 and Phase 2 control channels alongside DMR T2/T3
(#385), and a new "virtual voice pool" (#386) follows trunked voice
grants whose frequency lands inside the wideband IQ window — so a
single SDR can cover P25 CC + voice end-to-end. The wideband engine
also routes through the iqtap broker so the spectrum view works on
wideband-only deployments (#377). Two more Windows RTL-SDR cold-boot
stall paths now self-recover: #382 classifies the
`ERROR_GEN_FAILURE` NAK as `ErrPipeStalled` and clears the control
halt, and #393 makes WinUSB `Reset` re-open the device handle
(matching `libusb_reset_device`) and allows up to two settles during
open. Plus polish: r82xx PLL nint encoding limit widened to 268 so
V4-class dongles tune above ~140 MHz on the 16 MHz xtal (#391,
closes #264), CC Activity super-group patches finally render member
counts (#392, closes #374), and the misleading "voice pool full"
message is replaced with an actionable startup WARN pointing at
`docs/hardware.md` when no `role: voice` SDR is attached (#383,
closes #379).

### Added

- **AX.25 frame parser + APRS info-field decoder.** Third slice
  of Phase 5 (#365), the protocol layer that plugs into the
  bus/log/REST/UI scaffolding from #384. Pure-Go AX.25 frame
  parser (`internal/radio/aprs/ax25`): 7-byte address packing,
  up to 8 digipeater path entries, HDLC CRC-16-CCITT validation,
  conventional `W1AW-9` / `WIDE2-1*` display helpers. Plus an
  APRS info-field decoder (`internal/radio/aprs`) for positions
  (`!`, `=`, `/`, `@`), messages (`:`) with ack/rej + bulletins,
  status (`>`); Mic-E / weather / telemetry / object types are
  type-tagged with payloads stashed for follow-up decoders. The
  DSP receiver (Bell-202 AFSK demod → HDLC de-stuff → frame
  delivery → bus event) is the next focused PR. See
  [docs/aprs.md](docs/aprs.md).
- **Radio IDs as first-class entities (#387, #376).** New
  `trunking.RIDDB` operator-configured alias catalogue mirroring
  `TalkgroupDB`: per-system `rid_alias_file` (CSV or JSON, dispatched
  by extension) carrying `Decimal/DEC/ID` plus optional `Alias`,
  `Description`, `Tag`, `Group`, `Owner`, `Priority`, `Lockout`,
  `Watch`, `Icon` columns. `AffiliationTracker` gained `TalkerAlias`,
  `TalkerAliasAt`, `CallCount`, `FirstSeen` on `UnitActivity` and
  now subscribes to `KindTalkerAlias`. New HTTP routes `GET
  /api/v1/rids`, `GET /api/v1/rids/{id}`, `GET
  /api/v1/rids/{id}/history` (backed by `HistoryFilter.SourceID`),
  and `PATCH /api/v1/rids/{id}`. New gRPC `RIDService`
  (`ListRIDs` / `GetRID` / `ListRIDHistory`). New `/rids` web panel
  with the configured ∪ live merge, last-50-calls detail modal, and
  write-mode mutation controls. CC Activity RID chips are now
  clickable links into the detail view. See [docs/radio-ids.md](docs/radio-ids.md).
- **Standard P25 talker-alias voice-channel decoder.** Follow-up to
  #387 closing the second half of issue #376. Phase 1 LDU1 Link
  Control opcodes 0x15 (HEADER) / 0x16 (BLOCK1) / 0x17 (BLOCK2) are
  now reassembled by `phase1.StandardTalkerAliasBuf` (one buffer
  per active voice chain) and published as `KindTalkerAlias` events
  with the call's SourceID; the affiliation tracker stamps the
  decoded alias onto the RID row so it surfaces in
  `/api/v1/rids` and the Radio IDs panel. The existing Motorola
  vendor TSBK form (control channel) is unchanged. Phase 2 voice-MAC
  alias dispatch remains a follow-up.
- **APRS bus event + SQLite log + REST + web panel.** Second
  slice of Phase 5 (#365), building on the protocol layer from
  #381. New `events.KindAPRSPacket` bus event, `aprs_log`
  SQLite table, `storage.APRSLog` bus subscriber (mirrors
  `PagerLog`), `GET /api/v1/aprs/packets?limit=N` REST endpoint,
  and `/aprs` web panel rendering the live packet list (received
  time, src → dst + path, type, body, lat/lon, CRC-OK flag with
  yellow highlight on CRC failure). DSP wiring (Bell-202 AFSK
  demod → HDLC de-stuff → AX.25 framer → packet decoder → bus)
  is the remaining piece and lands in a focused follow-up PR.
- **POCSAG DSP receiver + daemon wiring.** Third slice of Phase 3
  (#365). New `internal/radio/pager/pocsag/receiver` package wires
  the FM demod → rational resampler → integrator-and-slicer → bit
  syncer pipeline together so a tuned SDR's IQ stream now flows
  end-to-end into the pager bus event. New `paging.pocsag` YAML
  section pins SDRs to paging frequencies (`serial` +
  `frequency_hz` + optional `baud_hz`). The daemon retunes the
  SDR on startup, subscribes to the iqtap broker, and runs one
  receiver per configured entry as a non-essential spawn (so a
  misconfigured paging frequency doesn't bring down the trunking
  pipeline). Synthetic-IQ end-to-end test is skipped pending
  real captured fixtures; receiver API surface (Options
  validation, ctx cancel, nil input) is unit-tested. See
  [docs/pocsag.md](docs/pocsag.md) for the configuration knob and
  what's pending (timing-recovery tuning against real fixtures,
  multi-channel-from-one-SDR DDC, FLEX).
- **Wideband channelizer hosts P25 Phase 1 + Phase 2 control
  channels (#385).** A single SDR pinned to a centre frequency can
  now host a P25 trunked control channel inside the wideband
  channelizer, alongside the existing DMR Tier II and Tier III state
  machines. The per-channel wiring uses a small `narrowbandReceiver`
  interface (`Process([]complex64)`) so the engine itself stays
  protocol-agnostic; P25 Phase 1 honours the system's
  `p25_phase1_demod_mode` (C4FM vs CQPSK / LSM) and any
  operator-supplied `P25BandPlan` entries, and P25 Phase 2 reuses the
  existing trellis / RS / interleave / scrambler / clock-mode knobs
  and the PN44 seed derivation so a wideband CC tap decodes
  identically to a dedicated CC dongle. Config validator accepts
  protocol `p25` / `p25-phase2` for wideband channels with the same
  control-channel-membership rule that already applies to DMR Tier
  III. Docs and `config.example.yaml` updated with worked P25
  examples. Voice grants on these protocols still route to the
  daemon's existing physical voice pool — the virtual voice pool
  (next bullet) covers in-window grants.
- **Virtual voice pool on the wideband dongle (#386).** A wideband
  dongle can now also follow trunked voice grants whose frequency
  lands inside its IQ window — DMR Tier III, P25 Phase 1, P25
  Phase 2 — without a separate `role: voice` SDR. New
  `internal/sdr/wbvoice` package: `VirtualTuner` implements both
  `trunking.Tuner` (`SetCenterFreq`, `CanTune`) and
  `composer.IQSource` (`StreamIQ`, `SampleRateHz`). Each tap
  subscribes to the wideband dongle's iqtap broker on demand, runs a
  single-tap DDC at the (target − wideband) offset, and emits 48
  kHz IQ to the composer's existing P25 / DMR voice chains — no
  changes to the receivers themselves. `voicepool.FindFreeForFrequency`
  consults an optional `FrequencyChecker.CanTune` on each free
  device, so a voice grant outside the wideband window passes over
  a virtual tuner and lands on the physical `role: voice` SDR when
  one is configured. One SDR end-to-end for any system whose
  carriers fit in a single 2.4 MHz band.
- **Wideband engine routes IQ + tuning through the iqtap broker
  (#377).** Wideband-only DMR Tier 2 deployments (single SDR,
  `role: wideband`, multiple T2 systems) couldn't render the
  spectrum waterfall because the engine consumed `StreamIQ` from
  the raw device and never fed the broker's fan-out. The wideband
  engine now takes the broker (mirroring the CC decoder wiring) so
  the spectrum panel works on wideband-only deployments. Also seeds
  each broker's sample-rate cache in `wrapIQBrokers` from
  `cfg.SDR.SampleRate` — the pool programs the rate on the raw
  device before the broker wraps it, so `Broker.SetSampleRate`'s
  cache path never ran and frames stamped `sample_rate_hz=0` for
  every device.

### Fixed

- **RTL-SDR cold-boot stall on Windows: deeper recovery for wedged
  clone dongles (issue #333).** The previous fix (#382) mapped
  `ERROR_GEN_FAILURE (0x1F)` to `ErrPipeStalled` and ran one
  clear-halt + re-claim retry, which recovers a stale endpoint halt
  but not a wedged firmware state from a prior crashed process.
  WinUSB `Transport.Reset()` now matches what `libusb_reset_device`
  does on Windows: clear-halt the control endpoint, drop the WinUSB
  handles, then re-open the device via `CreateFile` +
  `WinUsb_Initialize` (a true device-object re-bind, not just a pipe
  reset). The open-time bring-up envelope now allows up to two such
  resets per `Open` with 100 ms / 200 ms backoff, giving clones that
  need two settles to come back a chance to recover before surfacing
  the Zadig / port-choice / `gophertrunk sdr doctor` hint. Healthy
  dongles still open with zero resets and zero delay.
- **RTL-SDR cold-boot stall on Windows now self-recovers (#382).**
  Clone dongles (and some power-marginal hubs) latch the first
  USB_SYSCTL=0x09 vendor-OUT write, then NAK the byte-identical
  second write in `init baseband` step 0 with `ERROR_GEN_FAILURE
  (0x1F)`. The Linux equivalent (`EPIPE`) was already covered by the
  bring-up reset+retry envelope; the Windows path wasn't because (a)
  `ERROR_GEN_FAILURE` wasn't classified as resetable, and (b) the
  WinUSB `Transport.Reset()` was a no-op. WinUSB now clears the
  control-pipe halt via `WinUsb_ResetPipe(0)` (USB
  `CLEAR_FEATURE(ENDPOINT_HALT)`), the new `usb.ErrPipeStalled`
  sentinel keys the existing retry envelope, and a clone-dongle hint
  pointing at Zadig / port choice / `gophertrunk sdr doctor` is
  appended when the second attempt still fails.
- **r82xx setPLL nint encoding limit widened to 268 (closes #264).**
  The overflow guard used `0x3F + 13 = 76`, which only accounts for
  ni's 6-bit width and ignores that si's 2 extra bits also encode
  part of nint (register 0x14 = `ni | si<<6`; nint = `13 + 4*ni + si`).
  The real encoding cap is `13 + 4*0x3F + 0x3 = 268`. With R820T /
  R820T2's 28.8 MHz xtal the VCO range capped nint near 67 so the
  bug was latent; PR #266's correct R828D xtal (16 MHz) halves
  `pllRef` and pushes nint up to ~121 — the guard then rejected
  tunes above ~140 MHz on the V4 dongle, e.g. 153.5875 MHz →
  nint=78 overflows. Regression test pins the nint=78 math for the
  reporter's frequency.
- **CC Activity panel renders super-group patches with member counts
  (closes #374).** `eventToDTO` had no case for `trunking.Patch`,
  so the payload fell through to default and was JSON-marshalled
  with Go's PascalCase names (`SuperGroup`, `Members`, `Add`). The
  CC Activity panel reads snake_case fields (`super_group`,
  `members`, `add`) and was getting `undefined` for all of them —
  hence "super-group 0 · add" on every patch. New `PatchDTO`
  mirrors the established DTO pattern (snake_case JSON tags),
  `eventToDTO` dispatches to it, and the frontend cancel-detect
  honours the wire field (`add: false`) alongside the existing
  legacy fallbacks. SSE wire shape pinned by test using the values
  from the issue report.
- **Actionable "voice pool empty" diagnostic when no `role: voice`
  SDR is attached (closes #379).** When an operator booted with a
  trunked system but no voice SDR, every grant logged "voice pool
  full but no actives" — which read as "pool full" while the pool
  was in fact empty, and gave no clue that a second SDR or a
  wideband channelizer is required. `HandleGrant` now distinguishes
  the two cases: empty pool logs a one-shot actionable WARN
  pointing at [docs/hardware.md](docs/hardware.md) and drops
  subsequent grants at DEBUG; the genuine impossible state
  (devices > 0 but no actives) becomes Error so the bug stays
  visible. A new one-shot startup WARN from `Daemon.Run` surfaces
  the problem before the first grant arrives. Non-trunked
  deployments (POCSAG, conventional FM scanner, wideband T2
  capture-only, baseband recording) still run cleanly because the
  warning is gated on `len(systems) > 0`.

## [v0.2.3] — 2026-05-26

The "multi-consumer SDR + new operator panels" release. The new
iqtap broker (#365) made multi-consumer SDR fan-out possible without
forking IQ streams in each subscriber, which immediately unlocked a
batch of new operator-console capabilities: a Constellation viewer
that renders live IQ scatter alongside decode (#370), a CC Activity
panel that filters the events stream down to control-channel chatter
(#369), a UI-managed Bookmarks frequency manager backed by a new
SQLite table (#368), spectrum-panel click-to-tune + bookmark markers
(#371), a Hamlib `rigctld` TCP server for external amateur tooling
(Cloudlog, GridTracker, PSTRotator, `rigctl(1)` — #367), and a
remote `rtl_tcp` driver mounting any number of remote SDR servers as
virtual tuners alongside locally-attached USB dongles (#366). POCSAG
paging landed as the first two slices of Phase 3 of the
trunking-adjacent feature plan (#365): the BCH(31,21) FEC + codeword
wrapper + numeric / alphanumeric message decoders shipped as a
pure-protocol slice (#372), and the syncer + page assembler + bus /
log / REST / web panel scaffold plugged it into the operator surface
(#373); the DSP receiver wiring landed the following day in v0.2.4.
The wideband channelizer gained DMR Tier III control-channel support
(#363) and per-channel `ClockGain` matching the dedicated-dongle
path (#364) so wideband-hosted DMR repeaters lock as cleanly.
Windows 11 RTL-SDR driver-binding woes got a diagnostic answer
(`gophertrunk sdr doctor` — #359) since Windows has no equivalent
of `USBDEVFS_DISCONNECT`. Airspy R2 open ordering on Windows fixed
(#358) so it stops failing with `device disconnected` when
`sdr list` did detect the dongle. And the stuck voice-chain footgun
(#356) closed: the four voice composers now gate `Engine.Touch` on
actual decoder progress so the 30 s inactivity watchdog can fire
and release the bound voice SDR when transmission stops.

### Added

- **POCSAG syncer + page assembler + bus event + SQLite log +
  web panel.** Second slice of Phase 3 (#365), building on the
  protocol layer landed in #372. The new `pocsag.Syncer`
  consumes a packed bit stream, locks on the POCSAG sync
  codeword (with polarity-inverse fallback so a flipped FM
  demod still works), carves batches, decodes through
  BCH(31,21), and reassembles pages by correlating address +
  message codewords. Pages publish on a new
  `events.KindPagerMessage` bus event; a new SQLite `pager_log`
  table persists them; `GET /api/v1/pager/messages?limit=N`
  returns the most recent rows; `/pagers` web panel renders the
  live list (received time, RIC, function code, encoding, body,
  bit-error count). DSP wiring (FM demod → bit slicer →
  `Syncer.Push`) is the remaining piece and lands in a focused
  follow-up PR. See [docs/pocsag.md](docs/pocsag.md).
- **POCSAG paging protocol layer.** First slice of Phase 3 of the
  trunking-adjacent feature plan (#365). Adds BCH(31,21)
  encode/decode (corrects up to 2 bit errors per codeword) plus
  the POCSAG-specific codeword wrapper (sync `0x7CD215D8` + idle
  `0x7A89C197` recognition, trailing overall-parity check,
  address/message/function decoding), batch carve-up (sync + 16
  codewords × 8 frame slots, full-RIC reconstruction from the
  18-bit address-codeword field + slot index), and the
  numeric (CCIR 584 extended BCD: 0-9, *, U, space, -, ), ( ) +
  alphanumeric (7-bit LSB-first ASCII) message decoders. Pure
  protocol — the DSP wiring (FM demod → bit slicer → sync
  detector → batch decoder → bus event → SQLite log → web/TUI
  panel) lands in a focused follow-up PR. See
  [docs/pocsag.md](docs/pocsag.md).
- **Spectrum panel: click-to-tune + bookmark markers.** Closes the
  click-to-tune TODO from the bookmarks PR (#368). Clicking
  anywhere on the waterfall canvas now posts the bin's centre
  frequency to a new `POST
  /api/v1/spectrum/devices/{serial}/tune` endpoint and the SDR
  retunes immediately. The bookmarks list is polled every 30 s
  and rendered as small cyan ticks across the top of the
  waterfall wherever a bookmark frequency falls inside the visible
  band. Tune goes through the iqtap broker so the frequency stays
  coherent across the spectrum, constellation, rigctld, and CC
  decoder views, and survives `pool.Reacquire`.
- **Constellation viewer.** New web panel at `/constellation` that
  renders a live 2D scatter of decimated IQ samples (2 ksps
  default). Brighter dots = newer samples; reference rings at
  |z|=0.5 and |z|=1.0; per-frame dBFS energy banner. Identifies
  signal shape visually — PSK clusters, FSK arcs, AM rotation,
  noise circles, DC bias, frequency-offset spirals — without
  launching a separate SDR receiver alongside GopherTrunk. Builds
  on the iqtap broker (PR #365) so multiple subscribers share the
  same SDR's IQ stream without disturbing decode.
  `internal/dsp/diag` adds a pure-Go stride decimator + per-frame
  energy estimator; `WS /api/v1/diag/iq?device=...&rate=2000`
  exposes it. See [docs/constellation.md](docs/constellation.md).
- **CC Activity panel.** New web panel at `/cc` that filters the
  events stream down to control-channel chatter: voice grants,
  affiliations, registrations, patches / dynamic regroups, talker
  aliases, CC lock / loss, and call start/end. Per-row rendering
  pulls the right detail out of each payload (talkgroup + source
  + frequency + tags for grants, member count for patches,
  response codes for affiliations, the alias string for talker
  aliases). Kind + system substring filters narrow the view; a
  pause button freezes the display without disconnecting the
  bus. Pure filter view over events already on the bus — no new
  bus kinds or storage.
- **Bookmarks / frequency manager.** UI-managed conventional
  channel list (marine VHF, NOAA weather, FRS/GMRS, repeater
  outputs, public-safety conventional fall-backs) backed by a new
  `bookmarks` table in the daemon's SQLite database. Each row
  carries name, frequency, mode, optional CTCSS / DCS, freeform
  notes, and an operator-defined group tag. REST endpoints under
  `/api/v1/bookmarks` (read open; create / update / delete gated
  the same as every other write route); web panel at
  `/bookmarks`. Mutations publish `bookmark.{created,updated,
  deleted}` events on the bus so SSE / WS subscribers refresh
  without polling.
- **Hamlib `rigctld` TCP server.** Opt-in (`api.rigctld:
  "127.0.0.1:4532"`) endpoint speaking the standard rigctld wire
  protocol so external amateur-radio tooling (Cloudlog,
  GridTracker, PSTRotator, satellite trackers, `rigctl(1)`) can
  read and set the control SDR's frequency without learning the
  GopherTrunk REST API. Implements the ~10 commands real clients
  send (`F` / `f`, `M` / `m`, `V` / `v`, `T` / `t`, `chk_vfo`,
  `dump_state`, `q`); unknown commands return `RPRT -1` per
  Hamlib's "unsupported" convention. RX-only backend — `set_ptt 1`
  is rejected. Tuning routes through the iqtap broker so external
  retunes stay coherent with the spectrum panel's frequency axis
  and survive USB-disconnect cycles. See
  [docs/rigctld.md](docs/rigctld.md).
- **Remote `rtl_tcp` SDRs.** A new `rtltcp` driver mounts any number
  of remote `rtl_tcp` servers as virtual tuners alongside locally-
  attached USB dongles. The driver speaks the well-known librtlsdr
  wire protocol (12-byte `RTL0` header, u8 IQ stream, 5-byte command
  packets) used by SDR++, Gqrx, and OpenWebRX, so any host running
  `rtl_tcp` can publish its dongle to the daemon. Configure under
  `sdr.rtl_tcp` in `config.yaml`; each entry carries `addr`,
  optional `serial`, `role`, `ppm`, `gain`, `bias_tee`, and
  `connect_timeout_ms`. Pool roles, broker fan-out, baseband
  recording, and the live spectrum panel all work against remote
  sources just like local ones. Plaintext on the wire — restrict
  to trusted networks or wrap with SSH/WireGuard/Tailscale. See
  [docs/hardware.md](docs/hardware.md).
- **`role: wideband` SDR devices — one dongle, many DMR Tier II
  repeaters and DMR Tier III control channels.** A single SDR pinned
  to a centre frequency now decodes every conventional DMR repeater
  AND a DMR Tier III control channel inside its IQ bandwidth (e.g.
  several 12.5 kHz carriers within a 2.4 MHz IQ window around
  453 MHz), no extra hardware needed. Add a `role: wideband` entry to
  `sdr.devices` with a `center_freq_hz` and a `channels: [...]` list
  binding each frequency to a `trunking.systems` entry; per channel,
  systems with `protocol: dmr-tier2` get a Tier II `ConventionalChannel`
  state machine, systems with `protocol: dmr` get a Tier III
  `ControlChannel` (channel frequency must match one of the system's
  `control_channels`). T2 and T3 can mix on the same dongle. The
  daemon's `internal/scanner/widebandt2` engine fans the dongle's IQ
  out via the `internal/dsp/tuner` package (DDC-per-channel or shared
  polyphase channelizer, picked by channel count). See
  [`docs/hardware.md` § Sharing one dongle across multiple repeaters](docs/hardware.md)
  and `samples/dmr-tier2-multichannel/`. Tier III voice grants still
  route through the existing physical voice pool (a `role: voice`
  SDR follows the call); decoding T3 voice directly on the wideband
  dongle via a virtual voice pool is the next planned step (landed
  in v0.2.4 as #386).
- **`gophertrunk sdr doctor` — per-dongle driver-binding report.**
  Many Windows 11 users reported their RTL-SDR dongles weren't being
  recognized despite appearing in Device Manager, mirroring the
  Linux kernel-driver collision fixed in v0.2.2. Windows has no
  equivalent of `USBDEVFS_DISCONNECT` (you can't programmatically
  rebind a USB function driver), so the fix is diagnostic rather
  than mechanical: a new `sdr doctor` subcommand walks the OS USB
  tree, reads the bound function driver via SetupAPI
  (`SPDRP_SERVICE` / `SPDRP_DEVICEDESC`) on Windows or the
  interface-0 sysfs symlink on Linux, and prints a row per dongle
  with an actionable next step (run Zadig; pick Interface 0 not
  the composite parent; re-target WinUSB instead of libusbK;
  blacklist `dvb_usb_rtl28xxu`; etc.). Read-only — safe to run as
  a regular user alongside a live daemon.
- **Smarter `WinUsb_Initialize` error on Windows.** The error now
  embeds the currently-bound driver name and points the operator at
  `sdr doctor`, replacing the generic "driver not bound? run Zadig"
  message that gave the user no insight into what to actually fix.
- **Windows 11 driver-binding troubleshooting section** in
  `docs/user-guide-windows.md` § 4.2, covering Core Isolation /
  Memory Integrity, Smart App Control, Driver Signature Enforcement,
  Windows Update DVB-driver re-binding, multi-dongle gotchas,
  composite-device interface selection, libusbK / libusb-win32
  mistakes, USB Selective Suspend, xHCI controller quirks,
  antivirus blocking, Windows S mode, and Group Policy device-install
  restrictions.

### Fixed

- **Wideband DMR receiver loop-gain now matches the single-channel
  ccdecoder path.** The Stage 2 / Stage 3 wideband engine was
  instantiating `dmr/receiver.Receiver` with the default
  `ClockGain: 0.05`, which the existing ccdecoder pipelines
  explicitly lowered (0.015 for Tier II, 0.025 for Tier III) because
  the default doesn't reliably lock the Mueller-Müller clock loop on
  T2/T3 symbol distributions. The wideband engine now picks the
  right value per channel based on the system's tier, so wideband-
  hosted DMR repeaters lock as cleanly as the dedicated-dongle path.
  Verified by a new in-package end-to-end test in
  `internal/scanner/widebandt2/engine_e2e_test.go` that feeds
  synthesized Voice LC Header IQ through the engine and asserts a
  grant event lands on the bus.
- **trunking/composer**: Voice chains no longer keep a call alive
  forever via an unconditional 1 s heartbeat. The four chains
  (P25 Phase 1, P25 Phase 2, DMR, NBFM) now gate `Engine.Touch` on
  actual decoder progress — an LDU / superframe / voice subframe /
  PCM batch — so the 30 s inactivity watchdog can fire and release
  the bound voice SDR when transmission stops. Before this fix a
  stalled decoder (simulcast garbage, vocoder hang) refreshed
  `LastHeardAt` every tick regardless of whether any voice frames
  were decoded, leaving the active call permanently locked on a
  single talkgroup and every subsequent grant logging "no voice
  device available for grant" (issue #356, reporter @KN4MSH).
- **config**: New `trunking.call_timeout_ms` knob lets operators
  tune the watchdog timeout (still 30 s by default). Useful on
  systems with consistently clean signaling (lower for snappier
  teardown) or chatty channels with long transmission pauses
  (higher). Issue #356.
- **airspy**: Defer `SET_SAMPLE_TYPE` from `Open()` to `StreamIQ()`,
  matching libairspy's open ordering (`GET_SAMPLERATES` IN first,
  no vendor OUT during open). Fixes Airspy R2 failing to open on
  Windows with `winusb: WinUsb_ControlTransfer OUT: usb: device
  disconnected` even though `sdr list` detected the device
  (issue #270, reporter @VA7DBI).
- **windows usb backend**: Stop folding `ERROR_GEN_FAILURE` into
  `ErrDeviceGone`. That conflation printed "usb: device
  disconnected" for what is actually a firmware NAK / stalled
  pipe / wrong-driver-bound condition, and actively misled the
  issue #270 reporter. The error now names the Win32 code and
  suggests re-binding via Zadig.

## [v0.2.2] — 2026-05-25

Operational-recovery + Mt Anakie follow-up release. The reporter in
issue #345 — a NESDR SMArt v5 dropping off the USB bus multiple
times per day — was the proving ground for a full USB-disconnect
recovery suite: the bulk-IN reaper-death channel now surfaces silent
stalls through the ccdecoder retry loop, control SDRs reacquire by
serial without a daemon restart, voice SDRs reacquire on grant-time
tune failure, and a new SDR-pool watchdog re-enumerates registered
drivers periodically so a missing serial is re-bound the moment it
reappears. The same Mt Anakie site exposed two more P25 control-
channel gaps that v0.2.1's BCH + TSBK fixes uncovered: the site
broadcasts the TDMA `IdentifierUpdate` opcode (0x33 — v0.2.1 only
wired the VUHF variant 0x34), and grants arrive on channel IDs
before the matching IDEN_UP TSBK lands, so a pending-grant ring
(plus a config-driven band-plan seed for sites that never broadcast
some IDs at all) now drains every grant against the freshly-applied
slot. P25 calls also surface ALGID / KID end-to-end — log lines,
TUI, and both web panels render the algorithm name (`0x84
(AES-256)` / `0x81 (DES-OFB)` / `0xAA (ADP/RC4)`) the instant the
LDU2 Encryption Sync lands rather than just an opaque `enc=true`
flag. Web operator-console polish: empty WACN / SystemID / RFSS /
Site fields in the system detail modal now explain *why* they're
empty (control-channel hunt state). Repo polish: README trimmed
from 2,826 → ~210 lines with the long-form Status and Roadmap
chapters extracted into their own pages, the docs nav surfaces
previously-orphan pages (launcher, live-edits, DMR encryption,
release process), and the Dockerfile bumps to `golang:1.25` so
builds stop silently downloading the newer toolchain at every run.

### Added

- **TDMA `IdentifierUpdate` (TSBK opcode 0x33) wired through the
  Phase 1 dispatcher (issue #345).** v0.2.1 added the FDMA-
  flavoured VUHF variant (0x34, channel IDs 2 / 3 / 4 / 6 / 7 /
  8 / 14 / 15); the Mt Anakie site survey confirmed it broadcasts
  IDEN_UP for id=10 only as the TDMA variant (0x33, covering ids
  0 / 1 / 5 / 9 / 11 / 12 / 13), which the dispatcher silently
  ignored. Every Phase 2 grant on a TDMA id was black-holing with
  `decode.error stage=no-bandplan`. `ParseIdentifierUpdateTDMA`
  mirrors the VUHF bit packing (the on-air frequency-field layout
  per TIA-102.AABF Table 14 is identical; only byte 0's lower
  nibble differs — channel-type code vs bandwidth code), and
  channel-type → bandwidth mapping covers the documented Phase 2
  codes (0x1 → 6.25 kHz, 0x2 → 12.5 kHz, 0x3 → 6.25 kHz). Mt
  Anakie id=10 + num=176 now resolves to 468.6125 MHz.

- **Per-channel-ID deferred grant queue (issue #345).** Grants
  that reference a `BandPlan` channel ID before the matching
  `IdentifierUpdate` TSBK lands are now held in a bounded ring
  (cap 4 per ID, 5 s TTL) instead of dropping with
  `decode.error stage=no-bandplan`. When the IDEN_UP arrives the
  ring drains and re-publishes every queued grant through
  `publishVoiceGrant` against the freshly-applied slot. Covers
  the race where IDEN_UP cadence is slower than the first grant
  after CC lock.

- **Config-driven P25 band-plan seed.** New `p25_band_plan` list
  on `SystemConfig` with `channel_id` / `base_hz` / `spacing_hz`
  / `tx_offset_hz` / `bandwidth_hz` fields, validated for range
  and duplicates. The Phase 1 pipeline factory calls
  `BandPlan.Apply` for each entry at startup so sites that never
  broadcast IDEN_UP for a given channel ID can still resolve
  grants. Over-the-air IDEN_UPs override seeded entries through
  the same `Apply` path — entries are a floor, not a ceiling.

- **P25 ALGID / KID encryption metadata surfaced end-to-end
  (closes #353).** Phase 2 was already populating `Grant.ALGID`
  / `KID` but nothing downstream consumed them; Phase 1 carried
  them as zero until the LDU2 Encryption Sync arrived after
  voice acquisition. A new `KindCallEncryption` event lets the
  voice composer publish ALGID/KID the instant the LDU2 lands;
  the engine updates the bound `ActiveCall.Grant` via a new
  `VoicePool.UpdateEncryption` helper and republishes through
  the events bus. Wire-format additions cover REST/SSE
  (`GrantDTO`, `CallEncryptionDTO`), gRPC (pb `Grant` message),
  the TUI client mirror, and the web SPA (`GrantDTO`,
  `CallRow`, new `CallEncryptionEvent`). A new P25 algorithm-
  name registry renders `0x84 (AES-256)` / `0x81 (DES-OFB)` /
  `0xAA (ADP/RC4)` uniformly across the log line, the TUI
  active-call flag column, and both web panels' pills + detail
  views. Storage schema already had the columns.

- **SDR-pool periodic watchdog + voice-pool reacquire hook
  (issue #345).** Following the control-SDR re-acquire path
  shipped in PR #349, the same recovery now extends to voice
  dongles and to idle devices. When `VoicePool.Bind`'s
  `SetCenterFreq` fails — typically because a voice dongle
  disconnected between calls — the pool's new reacquire hook
  (wired by the daemon to `sdr.Pool.Reacquire`) re-opens the
  device by serial, swaps the fresh `Tuner` into the
  `VoiceDevice`, and retries the tune once before the call
  drops. Independently, the SDR pool runs a periodic watchdog
  (`sdr.watchdog_interval_ms`, default 30 s, opt-out via `-1`)
  that re-enumerates registered drivers, surfaces missing
  serials via `KindSDRDetached`, and calls `Pool.Reacquire` the
  moment a previously-missing serial reappears — so the next
  consumer touches a live handle instead of paying the
  reacquire round-trip mid-use. The watchdog only acts on the
  missing → reappeared transition: continuously-present devices
  are never touched.

- **Empty WACN / SystemID / RFSS / Site fields on the web
  systems detail modal now explain *why* they're empty (#342).**
  Those four identity fields populate from decoded P25 status
  broadcasts (TSBK 0x3A / 0x3B), not config, so they're empty
  until the control channel is locked and the broadcasts
  arrive. The detail modal used to show a bare em-dash, leaving
  operators unable to tell config mistakes from "not yet
  decoded". The scanner snapshot (`hunting` / `locked` / other)
  now drives per-field hint copy through a new `DetailField`
  `emptyHint` prop, pulled from the Systems-panel poll so the
  hint stays correct without visiting the Scanner page first.

### Fixed

- **Control SDR USB disconnect / re-enumerate now recovers
  in-process without a daemon restart (issue #345).** PR #348
  surfaced the silent-stall failure through the ccdecoder retry
  loop and escalated to a fatal exit so systemd / docker could
  restart the process; on a dongle that disconnects repeatedly
  (the reporter in issue #345 saw multiple drops per day on a
  NESDR SMArt v5) that meant the daemon kept exiting. The retry
  loop now first asks the `sdr.Pool` to re-acquire the control
  device by serial: best-effort close of the dead handle,
  driver re-enumerate, fresh `Open()` by the new USB index,
  sample rate + per-device Hint (PPM, gain, bias-tee) re-
  applied to the new handle, `Device` swapped in place in the
  `PoolEntry`, and `KindSDRDetached` + `KindSDRAttached` events
  republished so the API / TUI / web snapshot reflect the
  swap. `cchunt.Supervisor.SwapTuner` feeds the fresh handle to
  in-flight hunters by closing any armed retune channels so the
  next hunt round picks up the new tuner. The existing
  1 s / 2 s / 5 s / 10 s retry budget still applies — if the
  device stays gone after re-enumerate or `Open` fails, retries
  exhaust and the daemon still escalates to a clean fatal for
  the supervisor restart path.

- **`ccdecoder.StreamIQ` open-time errors now classify as
  `ErrIQStreamClosed` so the retry loop recovers (issue #345).**
  After the v0.2.1 retry path shipped, the reporter still saw
  the daemon's ccdecoder silently exit on a real RTL-SDR USB
  disconnect: the reaper would die mid-stream returning
  `ErrIQStreamClosed`, the retry loop would rebuild the decoder
  against the same dead `Tuner`, the rebuilt `StreamIQ` would
  fail with `usb: device disconnected` at the control-transfer
  `ResetBuffer` step, and the retry loop's `errors.Is` against
  `ErrIQStreamClosed` would miss. Non-context `StreamIQ` open
  errors are now wrapped as `%w: %w` against
  `ErrIQStreamClosed` so both shapes (mid-stream EOF and
  open-time `device disconnected`) classify the same way; the
  underlying error stays inspectable via `errors.Is` for the
  root cause.

- **USB bulk-IN reaper death now surfaces to the decoder
  instead of stalling silently (issue #345).** The shared
  bulk-IN reaper goroutine on every platform (linux / windows
  / darwin) used to exit silently when every URB became
  unrecoverable, leaving the driver's IQ consumer channel
  neither sending nor closed. ccdecoder's `select` blocked on
  the dead stream forever, `decoder.pump` stopped running, and
  every downstream `events.Publish` froze — the daemon went
  idle at 0% CPU with `gophertrunk_events_total` counters
  stuck, alive but inert. A new
  `usb.Transport.StartBulkIn.onStreamDead` callback fires
  exactly once when the reaper exits without `StopBulkIn`;
  each hardware driver (purego / airspy / airspyhf / hackrf)
  wires it into its existing cleanup goroutine via a
  `streamDead` channel + `sync.Once` so the consumer channel
  always closes — exactly once — on either ctx-cancel or
  reaper death. `ccdecoder.Run` then returns
  `ErrIQStreamClosed` on unexpected EOF, hitting the backoff-
  driven restart loop above (1 s / 2 s / 5 s / 10 s, with the
  attempt counter reset after a 60 s healthy run).

### Changed

- **README trimmed from 2,826 → ~210 lines.** The long-form
  "Status & known gaps" extracted into a new `docs/status.md`,
  the "Roadmap" into a new `docs/roadmap.md`, and the inline
  "Recently shipped" log removed because it duplicated
  `CHANGELOG.md`. Chapters that already live under `docs/` (TUI,
  Web console, API auth, FEC opt-outs, Repository layout,
  encyclopedic Quick Start) are now linked rather than
  duplicated. Nav (`docs/_data/nav.yml`) surfaces previously-
  orphan pages: launcher, live-edits, DMR encryption, release,
  and the new status / roadmap pages. Added Jekyll front matter
  to `launcher.md` and `dmr-encryption.md` so they render under
  the right group.

- **Dockerfile bumped `golang:1.24` → `golang:1.25`** to match
  `go.mod`'s Go 1.25.0 / toolchain 1.25.10. Builds were
  silently downloading the newer toolchain at every run.
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` bumps "Go 1.24+" → "Go 1.25+" to match.
  `.gitignore` now excludes `.env` / `.env.*` since
  contributors occasionally drop streaming credentials there
  while iterating. A new minimal
  `.github/pull_request_template.md` covers scope, test plan,
  breaking changes, and the docs/CHANGELOG checklist.

## [v0.2.1] — 2026-05-24

P25-on-live-air follow-up release, fixing every NID/TSBK-decode
bug that surfaced once real captures from the Mt Anakie site
went through the pipeline that landed in v0.2.0. The BCH(63,16,11)
generator polynomial is now spec-correct (was wrong by 10 exponents
against TIA-102.BAAA Annex A — synthetic round-trip tests had passed
because encoder + decoder shared the same wrong polynomial), the
TSBK CRC verifier switches to the augmented variant per TIA-102.AABF
(the previous CRC-CCITT/FALSE rejected clean Viterbi output), and
the VHF / UHF `IdentifierUpdateVUHF` band-plan opcode (0x34) is
wired into the dispatcher so UHF P25 sites resolve grants without
stalling on `no-bandplan`. A new C4FM symbol-AGC keeps the matched-
filter outer-symbol centres scaled correctly on real RTL-SDR
captures, and the offline `gophertrunk replay` / `iq-diag` tool
grows a TSBK dump + per-instance NID-search span so stubborn
captures are debuggable without a radio on the bench. Operator-
visible polish: the daemon's blank 404 at `/` (when a binary was
built without first running `make web-build`) now serves an HTML
page explaining the fix; `make dist` is the one-shot build target
that always embeds the SPA; duplicate SDR serials in `sdr.devices`
are caught at config-validation time with both indices named;
WinUSB `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` on Windows gets a remediation hint
pointing at other SDR apps; `internal/version` now auto-stamps
from Go's VCS info on a bare `go build`, so the version string is
no longer a useless `dev` when an operator skipped `make build`.

### Added

- **P25 Phase 1 `IdentifierUpdateVUHF` (TSBK opcode 0x34) wired
  through the dispatcher — UHF P25 sites resolve voice grants
  without stalling on `no-bandplan`.** The 0x34 opcode constant
  was already defined in `internal/radio/p25/phase1/opcodes.go`,
  but it had no parser and no `switch` case, so `IDEN_UP_VUHF`
  TSBKs arriving from a VHF / UHF site were silently dropped —
  the `BandPlan` stayed empty and every subsequent
  `GroupVoiceChannelGrant` emitted `decode.error
  stage=no-bandplan`. The CC lock itself worked fine; the failure
  was downstream of the lock and invisible without inspecting the
  events bus. `ParseIdentifierUpdateVUHF` /
  `AssembleIdentifierUpdateVUHF` decode the VHF/UHF bit packing
  per TIA-102.AABF Table 14a (4-bit `BW` lookup → 6.25 / 12.5 kHz
  per Table 16, 1-bit sign + 13-bit magnitude `TxOffset` whose
  unit is the channel step rather than a fixed 250 kHz, plus the
  same 10-bit `STEP × 125 Hz` and 32-bit `FREQ × 5 Hz` as the
  0x3D variant) and populate the existing `IdentifierUpdate`
  struct, so `BandPlan.Apply` / `BandPlan.Frequency` need no
  change. Cross-checked bit-by-bit against OP25
  (`op25/gr-op25_repeater/apps/trunking.py` `iden_up vhf uhf`)
  and SDRTrunk (`FrequencyBandUpdateVUHF.java`). Round-trip tests
  cover both negative offset (the typical UHF -5 MHz case) and
  positive offset (sign-bit coverage); a new end-to-end test
  feeds a VUHF `IdentifierUpdate` plus a subsequent grant through
  the real `ControlChannel.Process` chain and asserts the grant
  resolves to the expected frequency rather than falling to
  `decode.error`.

- **C4FM symbol-AGC on the P25 Phase 1 receive path (issue
  #275).** The P25 receive filter (`P25C4FMRxTaps`) is normalised
  to a DC gain of `sps`, so on real RTL-SDR captures the matched-
  filter outer-symbol centres land at `sps × 2π·deviation /
  sampleRate` radians — orders of magnitude larger than the
  ±3/±1 dibit decision boundaries the slicer expects. A per-
  symbol AGC now scales the matched-filter output back into the
  slicer's expected range, which is what made the BCH-decode
  fixes below visible on live air rather than just on synthetic
  modulator round-trip tests.

- **Offline `gophertrunk replay` / `iq-diag` tool grows TSBK dump
  + per-instance NID-search span (issue #275).** `replay -in
  capture.iq -diag` now appends the first 24 TSBK dibits at each
  perfect-distance FSW, which distinguishes a periodic fixed
  beacon (identical NID + identical TSBK) from a real CC
  (identical NID + varying TSBK) without running the trellis
  decoder. A new `-nid-search-span N` flag widens the
  NID-alignment search beyond the production default (±6 dibits)
  as a bisect knob for stubborn captures; the production
  `ccdecoder` is unchanged (zero in `Options` falls back to the
  default span). The tool is now documented in the README and
  `docs/hardware.md` so operators can use it without re-reading
  source.

- **`make dist` one-shot release-build target.** `make dist`
  runs `web-build` then `build` so the daemon binary always
  embeds the SPA; `make cross-build`, `make release-dry-run`,
  and `make run` now depend on `web-build` for the same reason.
  Closes the v0.1.x footgun where `go build ./cmd/gophertrunk`
  without first running `make web-build` produced a binary that
  silently 404'd at `/` (see Fixed below).

### Fixed

- **P25 Phase 1 BCH(63,16,11) generator polynomial was wrong by
  10 exponents against TIA-102.BAAA Annex A (issue #275).**
  `bch6316Generator` was `0xF391E2F34B99`; the spec polynomial —
  the product of the minimal polynomials of α, α³, α⁵, …, α²¹
  over GF(2⁶) with primitive `p(x) = x⁶ + x + 1` — is
  `0xCD930BDD3B2B`. Synthetic-modulator round-trip tests passed
  because the encoder and decoder both used the wrong polynomial,
  so the bug was invisible until the Mt Anakie capture went
  through the live pipeline (197/197 NID failures with the wrong
  polynomial, 195/197 clean decodes with the spec one). Per-DUID
  parity tables are now derived from the spec polynomial as well.
  A test shim with the old wrong polynomial hardcoded inline has
  been removed from `motorola/process_test.go` so the test
  exercises the same code path the daemon does.

- **P25 Phase 1 TSBK CRC verifier now uses the spec-correct
  augmented variant per TIA-102.AABF (issue #275).** The original
  trailer code used the "CRC-CCITT/FALSE" variant (init=0xFFFF,
  no final XOR, trailer stored inverted). The P25 spec — cross-
  checked against OP25 (`crc16_ccitt_xor`) and SDRTrunk
  (`CRCP25.checkCRCCCITT`) — uses the **augmented** variant
  (init=0xFFFF, the trailer participates in the LFSR shift, no
  final XOR or inversion). With PR #337's BCH polynomial fix
  alone, the Mt Anakie capture's TSBKs all came out of the
  trellis decoder with metric=0 (clean Viterbi path) but still
  failed CRC; with this fix the CRC verifier agrees with the
  trellis decoder and the TSBKs actually decode.

- **Motorola Type II patch members no longer emitted as
  triplicated talkgroup IDs (`[32501 32501 32501]`) — issue
  #275.** Audit ruled out a parser bug: `AsMotorolaPatchGroup`
  correctly reads three independent 16-bit fields, and the
  on-air payload bytes really are `0x7EF5` triplicated (Motorola
  pads short patch lists with the first member). The parser now
  deduplicates members on parse so a one-member patch is reported
  as one member instead of three.

- **Daemon now serves a helpful HTML page (not a blank stdlib
  404) at `/` when the SPA isn't embedded (issue #290).**
  `//go:embed all:dist` snapshots `web/dist/` at Go compile time,
  so a binary built without first running `make web-build`
  embeds only the `.gitkeep` sentinel and silently 404s at `/`.
  The 404 body now explains the cause and points at `make dist`;
  status code stays 404 so proxies/healthchecks are unaffected.
  Combined with the new `make dist` target above, the case
  shouldn't arise for release binaries.

- **`sdr.devices` config now rejects duplicate device serials at
  validation time (issue #333).** A Windows user listed the same
  RTL-SDR serial twice (control + voice) and the pool silently
  collapsed the hint, leaving WinUSB to fail the second
  `CreateFile` with `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` ("Toegang
  geweigerd") — a cryptic OS-level error that obscured a config
  mistake. `config.Validate()` now rejects duplicate serials in
  `sdr.devices` with a message naming both offending indices and
  explaining the one-SDR-per-role rule, and the RTL-SDR USB open
  path emits a remediation hint on Windows
  `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` pointing at other SDR apps that might
  be holding the dongle.

- **`internal/version` auto-stamps from Go's VCS info on a bare
  `go build` (issue #275).** Without the Makefile's `-ldflags`
  injection the version package stayed at its zero defaults
  (`Version="dev"`, `Commit=""`, `BuildTime=""`) and the
  `ccdecoder: p25/phase1 pipeline configured` log line printed
  `build=dev` even when source HEAD was a real commit. The
  package now falls back to `debug.ReadBuildInfo()` for both
  commit and build time when ldflags were not set, so issue-#275
  retest cycles where operators paste log excerpts always carry
  identifying build provenance. The Makefile-injected values
  still take precedence in production / release builds.

- **`TestDaemonCCDecodesDPMR` integration deadline is no longer
  flaky under `-race`.** dPMR runs at half the symbol rate the
  sibling P25 / DMR / NXDN tests use (2400 vs 4800 sym/s), so
  the same mock-SDR IQ chunk carries half the dibits per second
  and the cold-start path occasionally exceeded the 5 s lock
  deadline on slower hardware (~3% under `-race`). The deadline
  is now 30 s; steady-state lock time is still ~0.4 s, so the
  bump only affects worst-case slow paths.

## [v0.2.0] — 2026-05-23

SDR-fleet + DMR-voice + P25-lock release. The pure-Go SDR
backend grows from RTL-SDR-only into a full fleet — HackRF One
/ Jawbreaker / Rad1o, Airspy R2 / Mini, and the entire Airspy
HF+ family all gain native drivers with no `libhackrf` /
`libairspy` / `libairspyhf` at build or runtime, so the
single-static-binary guarantee holds across every supported
front-end. DMR gains its missing voice path: an AMBE+2 3600 ×
2450 vocoder decodes Tier II / Tier III voice superframes to
WAV. P25 Phase 1 control-channel lock on live air gets the
final attention pass it needed — NID-alignment search after
FSW, TSBK-CRC corroboration for marginal NIDs, restricted C4FM
rotation set, and a per-dibit error-pattern diagnostic that
makes lock failures debuggable from the log. A new
`gophertrunk replay` subcommand decodes captured wideband IQ
offline so issue triage doesn't need a radio on the bench.
RTL-SDR's classic "device busy" failure mode is gone — the USB
layer now auto-detaches the bound `dvb_usb_rtl28xxu` kernel
driver the way `libusb` does for `librtlsdr`, so the daemon
opens dongles out of the box without first blacklisting the
DVB module.

### Added

- **Airspy HF+ Discovery / Dual Port / legacy HF+ pure-Go driver.**
  New `internal/sdr/airspyhf` package implements the `sdr.Driver` /
  `sdr.Device` interfaces on top of the same pure-Go USB transport
  (USBDEVFS / WinUSB / IOKit) the RTL-SDR / HackRF / Airspy drivers
  use — no `libairspyhf` at build or runtime, the zero-CGO
  single-binary guarantee still holds. The driver speaks the
  documented libairspyhf USB vendor protocol (RECEIVER_MODE,
  SET_FREQ, GET_SAMPLERATES, SET_HF_AGC, SET_HF_ATT, SET_HF_LNA,
  SET_BIAS_TEE, GET_VERSION_STRING) and decodes the HF+'s
  interleaved int16 IQ payload into complex64. All three known
  variants (Discovery, Dual Port, legacy) enumerate on VID:PID
  `0x03eb:0x800c`; the USB descriptor's Product string drives the
  `TunerName` distinction. Coverage: 9 kHz – 31 MHz HF + 60 –
  260 MHz VHF; HF AGC plus a 0–48 dB attenuator (6 dB steps) and
  +6 dB LNA preamp. Registered on init so a blank import from
  `cmd/gophertrunk` is the only wiring needed. The wire protocol
  is unit-tested against `usb.MockTransport`; on-air validation
  against attached HF+ hardware is the documented follow-up.

- **HackRF firmware-aware identification.** The HackRF driver now
  reads `BOARD_ID_READ` and `VERSION_STRING_READ` at Open time and
  uses the firmware's self-reported identity (rather than the USB
  descriptor's Product string) to populate `sdr.Info.Product` as
  `HackRF One` / `HackRF Jawbreaker` / `Rad1o`. The running
  firmware version is appended to `TunerName` (`MAX2839+MAX5864
  (fw git-2024.02.1)`), and PortaPack / Mayhem builds are
  auto-detected and tagged with `+ PortaPack` so the operator can
  see at a glance which board is on which USB port. `Enumerate`
  also normalises Product based on the PID, so listings are
  consistent even before Open.

- **Airspy R2 vs Mini distinction in `TunerName`.** The Airspy
  driver now detects the `MINI` substring in the USB Product
  string at enumeration time and emits `R820T (Airspy R2)` or
  `R820T (Airspy Mini)` accordingly. Both variants share the same
  VID:PID, same R820T tuner, and same wire protocol — the split
  surfaces purely through the operator-visible label so multi-
  dongle pools can pick the right unit by name.

- **HackRF One and Airspy R2 / Mini pure-Go drivers.** New
  `internal/sdr/hackrf` and `internal/sdr/airspy` packages implement
  the `sdr.Driver` / `sdr.Device` interfaces on top of the same
  pure-Go USB transport (USBDEVFS / WinUSB / IOKit) the RTL-SDR
  driver uses — no `libhackrf` or `libairspy` at build or runtime,
  so the zero-CGO single-binary guarantee holds. The drivers speak
  the documented libhackrf and libairspy USB vendor protocols
  (transceiver / receiver mode, frequency, sample rate, LNA / VGA /
  mixer / amp / bias-tee gains, bulk-IN sample reaper with real-time
  decode of HackRF int8 IQ and Airspy INT16_IQ into complex64). Both
  register themselves with the SDR driver registry on init, so a
  blank import from `cmd/gophertrunk` is the only wiring needed. The
  wire protocols are unit-tested against `usb.MockTransport`; on-air
  validation against attached HackRF / Airspy hardware is the
  documented follow-up.

- **DMR voice decodes to playable WAV (issue #276).** The DMR
  voice path is now end-to-end: a Tier II / Tier III voice
  superframe decoder slices the AMBE+2 burst layout into the
  three 49-bit voice frames per burst, and a clean-room pure-Go
  AMBE+2 3600 × 2450 vocoder takes the on-air FEC-protected
  frames through soft-decision deinterleave → Golay(23,12,7) +
  Hamming(15,11,3) FEC → b₀…b₈ parameter extraction → MBE
  synthesis → 8 kHz PCM. The composer wires the chain into the
  recorder so a DMR voice grant now produces a WAV instead of an
  empty `.raw` sidecar. Encrypted DMR voice calls are detected
  (PI header keyword + signalling-flag check), tagged on the
  call record, and logged so an operator can tell at a glance
  why a recording is silent.

- **`gophertrunk replay` subcommand for offline IQ decoding.**
  A new top-level subcommand mounts a wideband IQ recording (the
  two-channel 16-bit WAV layout the daemon writes, or
  SDRtrunk's) into the SDR pool as a virtual tuner and runs the
  full decode pipeline against it with no radio attached. Issue
  triage (especially for #275) can now reproduce a control-
  channel-lock failure off a customer-supplied capture instead
  of needing the original site on the bench.

- **P25 Phase 1 control-channel lock on live air (issue #275).**
  Four targeted fixes to the NID acquisition path: (1) the
  alignment search now sweeps across symbols after the FSW
  rather than assuming bit-exact synchrony, fixing a class of
  marginal sites that previously never locked; (2) NID
  candidates with one or two residual bit errors are
  corroborated against the next TSBK's CRC before being accepted
  or rejected, so a single noisy NID dibit no longer drops the
  whole superframe; (3) the C4FM rotation set is restricted to
  the four physically realisable dibit phases, eliminating false
  locks on rotated noise; (4) on NID failure the decoder logs
  the per-dibit error pattern so a capture-driven debugger can
  see which specific symbols disagreed with the expected NID.
  At startup the `ccdecoder` now logs its NID-search parameters
  so the parameters used on a given run are visible in the log
  without having to read source.

- **DMR encryption guide.** A new
  [`docs/dmr-encryption.md`](docs/dmr-encryption.md) page
  documents the DMR encryption landscape (basic + enhanced
  privacy, ARC4 vs AES, key-management), what GopherTrunk does
  detect (the PI header, the signalling-flag bit, vendor key
  IDs) and what it deliberately does not do (decrypt without an
  operator-supplied key), with worked log examples.

### Fixed

- **RTL-SDR dongles now open even with the DVB kernel driver still
  bound.** On Linux the kernel binds `dvb_usb_rtl28xxu` (the DVB-T
  TV-tuner driver) to RTL-SDR dongles at plug time. An operator who
  hadn't blacklisted that module saw the daemon fail every device
  with `open device failed … claim interface 0: device or resource
  busy` followed by `SDR pool open failed … no SDR devices opened` —
  even though `sdr list` (which only reads USB descriptors) happily
  showed the dongles. The USB layer now detaches the bound kernel
  driver and retries the claim — the same auto-detach-kernel-driver
  behaviour `librtlsdr` gets from libusb — so GopherTrunk opens the
  dongle out of the box. Blacklisting the module is still recommended
  (it stops the kernel grabbing the device first) but no longer
  required. A claim error that survives the auto-detach now carries a
  hint that another user-space process is holding the dongle.
- **Empty talkgroup CSV no longer reported as a load failure.** A
  talkgroup CSV that existed but was empty (a freshly-touched
  placeholder, or a system whose talkgroups aren't catalogued yet)
  made the daemon log a scary `WARN talkgroup load failed … err="read
  csv header: EOF"`. An empty file is a legitimate "no talkgroups"
  state: `LoadCSV` now loads it cleanly as zero records, and preflight
  surfaces an actionable `talkgroup_file … is empty` warning instead.

## [v0.1.8] — 2026-05-21

P25 reception + voice-path release. The bulk of the work makes
trunked control-channel decode actually lock on live RTL-SDR
hardware (issue #275): IQ-stream channelization, cross-chunk
frame assembly, symbol-clock chunk-boundary fixes, a CQPSK / LSM
demodulator path with a blind equalizer and AGC for simulcast
sites, and coarse AFC for tuner carrier offset. On top of that,
P25 Phase 1 and Phase 2 are built out to functional SDRtrunk
parity with working voice decoding, and DMR gains a voice
decoding path (issue #276) where it previously decoded control
channels only. The web console's connect-time render loop and
WebSocket reconnect storm (issue #290) are both fixed.

### Added

- **Protocol-agnostic affiliation tracker.** A new
  `trunking.AffiliationTracker` maintains a live "which radio unit
  is on which talkgroup" table, fed by `KindGrant` (the grant's
  source/group is ground truth), explicit `KindAffiliation` events,
  and `KindUnitRegistration`. Because every protocol's grant carries
  a source and group, the table works uniformly across P25, DMR
  (all tiers and vendors) and NXDN with no per-protocol decoding.
  Idle units expire after a TTL. Served at `GET /api/v1/affiliations`.
- **Per-talkgroup mute and icon assignment.** A talkgroup can carry
  a `mute` flag (suppresses its calls from the live audio player
  while still following, recording and streaming them) and an
  `icon` name (the data model behind SDRtrunk's Icon Manager) — set
  via CSV column, JSON field, or `PATCH /api/v1/talkgroups/{id}`,
  and surfaced in the talkgroup API DTO.
- **Analog-trunking voice decoding.** Motorola Type II / SmartZone,
  EDACS, LTR and MPT 1327 calls now decode to audio through the
  composer's FM voice chain — they carry plain narrowband FM, so the
  existing FM chain is the correct decoder. EDACS ProVoice (digital,
  patent-encumbered) stays on the `.raw` sidecar path.
- **Outbound call streaming to aggregators and live audio
  servers.** Completed calls are now encoded to MP3 and streamed
  to external services, closing the largest functional gap
  against SDRtrunk. A new `internal/broadcast` subsystem
  subscribes to a `KindCallComplete` event the recorder
  publishes once a call's WAV is flushed, encodes the audio via
  a pure-Go MP3 encoder (`internal/voice/mp3`, no CGO), and
  fans the call out to every configured backend with bounded
  exponential-backoff retry. Four backends ship: Broadcastify
  Calls (two-step metadata + audio upload), RdioScanner
  (native call-upload API), OpenMHz, and live Icecast/ShoutCast
  (a continuous paced source connection topped up with silence
  between calls). Feeds are configured under a new `broadcast:`
  config section; each feed takes an optional `systems:` filter
  and a talkgroup can opt out of all feeds with `stream: false`
  in its CSV/JSON. Feed counters are exposed at
  `GET /api/v1/broadcast`.
- **Per-talkgroup recording assignment.** A talkgroup can now be
  flagged `record: false` (CSV column, JSON field, or
  `PATCH /api/v1/talkgroups/{id}`) to follow and play its calls live
  while writing no WAV/raw files for it — the recording analogue of
  the `stream` opt-out. Both `stream` and `record` are now surfaced
  in the talkgroup API DTO and accepted by the PATCH endpoint.
- **Decoded-message log.** A new optional `MessageLog`
  (`internal/log`) writes a human-readable, timestamped text log of
  every trunking event the bus carries — grants, control-channel
  lock/loss, affiliations, registrations, patches, talker aliases,
  locations, tone alerts, decode errors — the GopherTrunk analogue
  of SDRtrunk's per-channel decoded message log. The file rotates to
  `<path>.1` past a configurable size cap. Enabled via a new
  `log.message_log` config block.
- **GPS / location subsystem.** Geographic fixes a subscriber unit
  reports over the air now flow through a new `KindLocation` event
  (`trunking.Location` payload) to a `location_log` SQLite table and
  out via `GET /api/v1/locations` for map display. A new
  `internal/radio/location` package implements a strict NMEA-0183
  GGA/RMC parser — the format Tait CCDI and many MOTOTRBO GPS
  profiles transport verbatim — with checksum verification. The
  per-protocol binary GPS PDU extractors (P25 Motorola Unit GPS,
  L3Harris Talker GPS, DMR LRRP) and the web map page build on this
  backbone; their bit-exact wiring is pending capture validation.
- **DMR vendor-trunking recognition (FID-aware CSBK dispatch).**
  The Tier III control-channel decoder now dispatches each CSBK on
  its feature-set ID (FID) before opcode, so a Motorola or Hytera
  vendor CSBK is no longer misdecoded against the standard ETSI
  opcode table — previously a vendor CSBK whose 6-bit opcode
  collided with `0x30` would emit a bogus voice grant. Motorola
  Capacity Plus / Capacity Max voice grants (FID 0x10), which carry
  the ETSI-shaped 8-octet payload, now decode to real grants, and
  the Capacity Plus rest channel is tracked from its system-info
  CSBK. Connect Plus and Hytera XPT CSBKs are recognised and routed
  to a vendor handler; bit-exact decoding of those proprietary
  payloads is pending on-air capture validation.
- **Wideband baseband (IQ) recording and offline replay.** A new
  `internal/sdr/baseband` package adds two capabilities SDRtrunk
  has and GopherTrunk lacked. A `RecordingDevice` decorator tees a
  live tuner's IQ stream to a two-channel 16-bit WAV (in-phase in
  channel 1, quadrature in channel 2 — the same layout as
  SDRtrunk's baseband recordings). A `FileDriver` mounts those
  recordings (and SDRtrunk's) back into the SDR pool as virtual
  tuners, so a capture can be decoded offline with no radio
  attached; replay loops on EOF to behave like a continuous
  source. Both are configured under a new `baseband:` config
  section (`record:` and `replay:` lists).
- **P25 Phase 1 voice decoding and broader control-channel
  coverage** (PR #310). A `p25` voice grant now decodes
  end-to-end — modulated C4FM IQ → Phase 1 receiver → LDU
  assembly → IMBE voice frames → WAV; the composer previously
  bypassed the P25 Phase 1 voice path and produced no audio.
  The control-channel decoder gains wider TSBK grant coverage
  (unit-to-unit voice grant, explicit/implicit group update,
  telephone-interconnect grant, SNDCP data-channel grant),
  manufacturer-specific TSBK dispatch by MFID (Motorola /
  Harris group-regroup, multi-fragment vendor talker alias),
  LDU1 Link Control and LDU2 Encryption Sync decode (algorithm
  and key ID surfaced — identify, not decrypt), a `NetworkModel`
  that accumulates system topology (WACN, RFSS / site IDs,
  secondary control channels, neighbour sites), and a
  packet-data decode layer (PDU reassembly → SNDCP → IPv4
  header). Patch / regroup and talker-alias announcements
  publish through the new `KindPatch` / `KindTalkerAlias` event
  kinds.
- **P25 Phase 2 TDMA decode path** (PR #308, #309). P25 Phase 2
  grew from a control-channel-only stub into a full TDMA
  decoder. A `SuperframeDecoder` locks the 360 ms superframe and
  slices its 12 sub-frames; SlotType decode separates voice from
  MAC sub-frames; `ExtractVoiceFrames` pulls AMBE+2 frames from
  4V / 2V voice slots; and a composer voice chain decodes a
  `p25-phase2` grant end-to-end (modulated IQ → receiver →
  superframe decode → AMBE+2 → WAV). The live control-channel
  pipeline now runs through the structured `SuperframeDecoder`.
  Parity additions: encryption identification (`Encrypted` /
  `Emergency` / `AlgorithmID` / `KeyID` on the grant), Motorola /
  Harris patch / regroup feeding an engine `PatchRegistry`,
  multi-fragment talker-alias reassembly, band-plan
  channel-to-frequency resolution, MFID-keyed vendor MAC
  dispatch, and the opt-in TIA-102.BBAC per-burst block
  deinterleaver (`p25_phase2_interleave_mode`). Phase 2 now
  emits `KindAffiliation` / `KindUnitRegistration` / `KindPatch`
  / `KindTalkerAlias` like Phase 1.
- **DMR voice decoding path and Enhanced Privacy key
  configuration** (issue #276, PR #298, #301, #304, #305). DMR
  previously decoded control channels only. The voice path now
  ships: a DMR voice superframe decoder plus AMBE+2
  forward-error-correction (`internal/radio/dmr/voice/` — 72-bit
  on-air frame → C0/C1 Golay(23,12) + C1 descramble → 49-bit
  vocoder payload, ported from mbelib / DSD), and a composer DMR
  voice chain that runs IQ → DMR receiver → superframe decoder →
  AMBE FEC and writes the FEC-decoded frames to the call's
  `.raw` sidecar. A dependency-free RC4 keystream generator
  (`internal/crypto/rc4/`) and per-system `encryption_keys`
  config (`key_id` + `algorithm: rc4` + hex `key`, validated at
  load) lay the foundation for known-key Enhanced Privacy voice
  decryption.
- **P25 Phase 1 CQPSK / LSM demodulator path** for simulcast P25
  sites (issue #275). New per-system YAML key
  `p25_phase1_demod_mode: cqpsk` routes the control-channel IQ
  through a complex RRC matched filter + Gardner timing recovery +
  differential QPSK quadrant decode with LSM dibit remap, replacing
  the FM-discriminator + 4-level slicer path that produces near-
  random dibits on Linear Simulcast Modulation. The C4FM path stays
  the default for conventional non-simulcast deployments. Pipeline
  construction now logs `ccdecoder: p25/phase1 pipeline configured
  demod=…` so operators can confirm which path is active.
- **P25 Phase 1 CQPSK blind equalizer for simulcast multipath**
  (issue #275, PR #306). A P25 simulcast site sums several
  synchronised transmitters into a multipath channel that closes
  the CQPSK constellation, so the Frame Sync Word never
  correlates and the control channel never locks. Because LSM is
  a linear modulation the distortion is linear in the complex
  symbols: the `equalizer.CMA` blind (Constant Modulus
  Algorithm) equalizer is now wired onto the CQPSK symbol stream
  between Gardner timing recovery and the differential decode.
  It needs no training sequence and is a near-noop on a clean
  constant-modulus signal. The #275 IQ-impairment harness gains
  a multipath channel model.
- **Coarse AFC on the P25 Phase 1 C4FM control channel** (issue
  #275, PR #303). A residual RTL-SDR carrier offset leaves the
  FM discriminator with a constant DC bias that shifts the C4FM
  4-level slicer's eye off its decision regions; at ≥500 Hz the
  Frame Sync Word stops correlating entirely. A new coarse-AFC
  stage (`demod.CoarseAFC`) between the matched filter and the
  symbol clock tracks the bias with a slow single-pole average
  and subtracts it, recentring the eye. On a clean signal the
  estimate converges to ~0 and the stage is a near-noop.
- **Multi-rotation FSW search** on the P25 Phase 1 sync detector.
  `SyncDetector.ProcessWithRotation` tries all four cyclic shifts
  of the dibit alphabet against the canonical FrameSyncWord and
  returns the rotation that matched, absorbing residual symbol-
  polarity / I-Q-swap ambiguity. The downstream control-channel
  parser inverts the rotation before NID BCH + TSBK trellis decode.
  Rotation=0 wins on ties so existing clean-fixture tests stay
  green.

### Fixed

- **Web console WebSocket reconnect storm and intermittent
  crash** (issue #290, PR #302). The event-stream client reset
  its reconnect backoff the instant a socket opened, so a
  connection that opened then dropped immediately
  reconnect-stormed at the floor delay forever; the backoff now
  resets only after a connection holds open for a stability
  window, and reconnect delays carry equal jitter. Socket
  teardown nulls every handler and gates status writes behind a
  `closed` flag, so a late event from an in-flight socket can no
  longer write to the store after teardown and trip a React
  render crash. The health-check and event-stream effects are
  keyed on the primitive server URL / token values instead of a
  derived object so they re-run only on a real server change.
- **Web console SPA render loop blanked the UI on connect**
  (issue #290, PR #295). `selectClientConfig` returned a fresh
  object on every call, so the WebSocket effect — which listed
  the derived config in its deps and synchronously wrote
  connection status to the store — re-fired without bound (React
  error #185), blanking the UI and churning the socket open /
  close. The selector is now memoised to a stable reference
  until the server URL / token actually change; the event
  WebSocket URL is rebuilt with the URL API (handles uppercase
  schemes, never emits a host-less URL); and a top-level
  `ErrorBoundary` shows a fallback instead of a blank page on a
  render crash.
- **P25 Phase 1 CQPSK control channel locked only in a narrow
  RTL-SDR gain window** (issue #275, PR #307). The CMA blind
  equalizer added for simulcast P25 made the CQPSK path
  gain-sensitive: the Gardner timing-error detector and the CMA
  weight update both use un-normalised, amplitude-dependent
  error terms, so the chain converged only when the signal sat
  in a narrow amplitude band. An AGC on the matched-filter
  output now normalises every capture to the level the Gardner
  and CMA loops are tuned for, restoring scale invariance
  regardless of front-end gain. `dsp.AGC` was reworked from a
  per-sample feedback loop — which spiked into gain runaway on a
  near-zero symbol of a linear-modulation stream — into a robust
  power-EMA feed-forward normaliser.
- **P25 Phase 1 symbol-clock loops miscounted symbols across
  IQ-chunk boundaries** (issue #275, PR #300, #311). Both
  symbol-timing-recovery loops rebuild their working buffer each
  call but mishandled the chunk seam, so the recovered dibit
  count depended on IQ chunk size — a live RTL-SDR delivers
  ~19-symbol USB transfers, and the drift scattered dibit errors
  so the Frame Sync Word never aligned and the control channel
  never locked. The Gardner loop (CQPSK / LSM path) re-emitted
  ~1 surplus symbol per call; the Mueller-Müller loop (C4FM
  path) dropped `src[0]` of every continuation chunk. Both now
  treat the carried-over samples as pure look-back context, so
  the recovered dibit stream is byte-identical regardless of
  chunk size.
- **P25 Phase 1 dibit-rotation inversion broke simulcast
  control-channel lock** (PR #296). The FSW sync detector
  reports rotation `k` such that `(received + k) mod 4` is
  canonical, so dibits are recovered by adding `k` — but
  `rotateDibits` added `(4-k) & 3`, correct only for even
  rotations. The odd quadrant slips (1, 3) that the CQPSK / LSM
  demod leaves on simulcast P25 recovered every dibit off by
  two, so the NID BCH decode failed and the control channel
  never locked.
- **Trunked control-channel decode on live RTL-SDR hardware**
  (issue #275). The ccdecoder fed every per-protocol receiver the
  full, un-channelized SDR IQ stream (commonly 2.048 MHz), so the
  matched filter + symbol-clock loop ran at ≈427 samples per symbol
  against a ±1 MHz swath and the Frame Sync Word never correlated —
  no protocol could lock on-air, regardless of gain, PPM, or demod
  mode. A digital down-converter now decimates each raw IQ chunk
  (rational polyphase resample) to the narrowband channel rate the
  per-protocol receivers are matched-filter-tuned for — ~48 kHz for
  the 4800-baud C4FM family, 144 kHz for TETRA — before the pipeline
  sees it. The IQ-power gauge still reports the raw SDR input level.
- **P25 Phase 1 control channel never locked on live SDR chunking**
  (issue #275). The control-channel state machine discarded every
  Frame Sync Word hit unless the whole 154-dibit frame (FSW + NID +
  TSBK) fell inside a single `Process` call. A live RTL-SDR delivers
  16 KiB USB transfers — only ~19 P25 symbols per call — so the NID
  never fit and the channel never locked, even with the IQ stream
  correctly channelized. `ControlChannel.Process` now accumulates
  dibits across calls and assembles frames that straddle IQ-chunk
  boundaries.
- **macOS device enumeration panicked before listing any
  RTL-SDR** (issue #257, PR #293). The macOS USB enumerator
  registered CoreFoundation function pointers whose signatures
  named a `[16]byte` array type; purego's `RegisterLibFunc`
  panics with "unsupported kind array" on any array in a
  registered signature, so IOKit failed to load for every macOS
  user before a single call ran and `sdr list` found no devices.
  The 16-byte `CFUUIDBytes` is now passed as two `uint64`
  register halves. Per-driver enumerate errors also surface from
  `EnumerateAll`, so `sdr list` prints the failure instead of a
  silent empty list.
- **Config rejected valid trunking protocols** (issue #291, PR
  #294). Config validation hardcoded a `p25|dmr|nxdn` whitelist
  that was never updated as the other protocols landed, so a
  valid `protocol: tetra` (or edacs / ltr / mpt1327 / …) system
  failed at load despite being fully implemented. Validation now
  routes through `trunking.ParseProtocol` — the same parser the
  daemon uses — so the canonical protocol list is the single
  source of truth.

## [v0.1.7] — 2026-05-19

Observability + import-pipeline release. Twelve merged PRs land the
first batch of per-system Prometheus metrics (issue #269), unblock
RadioReference imports for the post-layout-change PDF format plus
non-US (Australian MMR) systems and native RR CSV downloads (issue
\#271, #278, #279), and close two RTL-SDR silent-failure modes that
prevented P25 control-channel lock on plug-in: a missing
`SetSampleRate` on pool open (issue #275, PR #281) and a Windows
cold-boot warmup timeout that wasn't on the bring-up retry envelope
(PR #274). P25 phase-1 affiliation and unit-registration events now
flow through the SSE/WS telemetry stream (slice of issue #268, PR
\#285). New `gophertrunk_sdr_iq_power_dbfs` gauge + throttled
low-power log catch the gain-at-zero / antenna-disconnected case
operators previously had to guess at (issue #275 follow-ups, PR
\#282).

### Added

- **Prometheus metrics for per-system call rate, encryption breakdown,
  control-channel health, and SDR device tuning state** (issue #269,
  PR #272). New series:
  `gophertrunk_calls_started_total{system,protocol,encrypted}`,
  `gophertrunk_control_channel_frequency_hz{system}`,
  `gophertrunk_control_channel_transitions_total{system,event}`,
  `gophertrunk_sdr_gain_db{driver,serial,role}`,
  `gophertrunk_sdr_gain_auto{driver,serial,role}`,
  `gophertrunk_sdr_ppm{driver,serial,role}`,
  `gophertrunk_sdr_bias_tee{driver,serial,role}`. SDR tuning gauges
  come from a scrape-time snapshot collector so they always reflect
  live pool state.
- **`gophertrunk_sdr_iq_power_dbfs{system}` gauge** updated roughly
  once per second from the cc decoder with mean |IQ|² converted to
  dBFS (issue #275 follow-ups, PR #282). Idle is ~-45 dBFS, healthy
  signal ~-25 dBFS, > -3 means the ADC is clipping. The series is
  dropped on decoder teardown so stale dBFS doesn't outlive the
  active system. Paired with a throttled low-power debug log on the
  same path: < -55 dBFS prints `ccdecoder: iq power very low — check
  antenna, gain, USB` at most once per 5 s — catches the
  gain-at-zero / antenna-disconnected / USB-stuck cases without
  flooding the log.
- **P25 phase-1 affiliation and unit-registration telemetry events**
  (slice of issue #268, PR #285). The cc decoder previously
  recognised TSBK opcodes 0x28 (Group Affiliation Response) and 0x2C
  (Unit Registration Response) but silently dropped them at the
  `dispatchTSBK` default branch. Both opcodes now decode through new
  parsers in `internal/trunking`, publish via two new event kinds
  (`KindAffiliation`, `KindUnitRegistration`), and reach the
  `/api/v1/events` SSE/WS stream as JSON-tagged DTOs. Byte layouts
  follow OP25's `trunk_p25.py` reference. Two regression tests pin
  the JSON shape so downstream dashboards can rely on stable field
  names.
- **Native RadioReference CSV import** for `gophertrunk import-pdf`
  (issue #271, PR #273). RadioReference's `/db/sid/<sid>/download`
  CSV is a flat talkgroup list with no metadata — the importer
  auto-detects the format and the new `-name` / `-sysid` flags
  supply the missing fields (filename stem is used when `-name` is
  omitted). Native CSV carries no sites; combine with a `-pdf` (or
  bundle CSV) when you need control-channel frequencies.
- **`-extract-only` flag for `gophertrunk import-pdf`** (PR #273).
  Paired with a single `-pdf`, dumps the positioned-text rows
  extracted from the PDF as JSON to stdout and exits, so parser bug
  reports can ship a ready-to-replay fixture without sharing the
  original PDF.
- **Per-(VID, PID) bias-tee GPIO table** for the pure-Go RTL-SDR
  driver (issue #275 follow-ups, PR #282). The hardcoded `GPIO 0`
  constant in `device.go` moved to a `knownDevice.BiasTeeGPIO`
  field. Every current entry inherits `GPIO 0` (the dominant
  RTL-SDR.com v3+ / NESDR Smart v5 pinout), but the mechanism now
  exists for boards with a different pinout to be added without
  forking the driver.
- **Throttled "no sync hits" debug log on P25 phase-1 and phase-2
  process paths** (PR #281). A 2 s-throttled line fires when the
  sync detector finds zero hits in a chunk — surfaces the
  previously-silent "IQ isn't reaching the decoder" case operators
  couldn't tell apart from a wrong-frequency cc.
- **"The Story of GopherTrunk" page** on the Pages site
  (PR #280) — project origin and design philosophy, linked from
  the README intro and support page.
- **Discord and Reddit community callouts** on the Pages site
  (PR #286).

### Changed

- `gophertrunk_calls_total` now carries `{system,protocol,encrypted,reason}`
  labels (was `{reason}`); `gophertrunk_calls_active` is now a
  GaugeVec keyed by `{system,protocol}` (was a bare gauge).
  Dashboards that previously scraped the unlabeled shape can recover
  with
  `sum without(system,protocol,encrypted) (gophertrunk_calls_total)`.
- **SDR pool now programs the IQ sample rate at device open** (issue
  \#275, PR #281). `Pool.Open` takes the rate as its first argument
  and calls `SetSampleRate` on every device immediately after the
  USB open; `SetSampleRate` failure closes that device and drops it
  from the pool rather than letting a wrong-rate radio poison the
  decoder. The pure-Go RTL-SDR driver also programs 2.048 MS/s in
  `runBringup` as a belt-and-suspenders default for any future
  consumer of the driver.
- `docs/import.md` and `docs/user-guide-windows.md`: RadioReference
  moved the PDF export from the page footer to the top **Download**
  menu (PDF / CSV / DSD options at `/db/sid/<sid>/download`).
  Instructions updated.

### Fixed

- **RTL-SDR P25 control channel never locked on a freshly opened
  device** (issue #275, PR #281). The pool opened devices and
  applied PPM / gain / bias-tee but never called `SetSampleRate`,
  so the chip's resampler stayed at whatever divisor it powered up
  with while every decoder pipeline downstream did its
  matched-filter and symbol-clock math against `cfg.SDR.SampleRate`.
  Symptom on real hardware was a silent failure: symbol timing
  wrong, FSW / 20-dibit outbound sync detector never matched, and
  the only log line that fired was the cc-hunt retune. The pool now
  programs the rate at open time (see Changed above).
- **`gophertrunk sdr list --probe` fatal-erroring on Windows cold
  boot** (PR #274). The WinUSB warmup sysctl-write returned
  `ErrTimeout` (the Windows equivalent of the Linux EPIPE stall),
  but `isBringupResetable` only matched EPIPE / `ErrDeviceGone`, so
  the existing bring-up `USBDEVFS_RESET` + re-claim retry envelope
  skipped this path. `ErrTimeout` is now treated as resetable; the
  retry stays one-shot, so worst-case cost on a genuine
  (non-cold-boot) timeout is one wasted ~200 ms reset before the
  original error resurfaces. `tunerBringupHint` also grew a
  Windows-aware remediation pointing at the Zadig step for the case
  where the retry also times out.
- `gophertrunk import-pdf` no-System-Name error now prints the
  first ~30 extracted rows inline so the failure is self-diagnosing
  (issue #271, PR #273).
- `parseMetaLine` accepts case-insensitive and whitespace-variant
  labels (`SYSTEM NAME:`, `System Name :`, double-spaces). Falls
  back to the page-title banner ("`<System> Menu`") when no
  explicit `System Name:` line is present, so a minor RadioReference
  layout tweak no longer breaks extraction (issue #271, PR #273).
- `extractPDFRows` now auto-detects RadioReference's two PDF font
  encodings (issue #271, PR #277). Older RR PDFs ship raw glyph
  bytes that need a `+27` ASCII shift; newer ones (e.g. MMR.pdf,
  sid 7197) embed a proper font CMap and arrive already-decoded.
  The extractor sniffs the first 50 rows for anchor strings
  (`System Name`, `Sites and Frequencies`, `Talkgroups`, `WACN`,
  `Last Updated`) and applies the shift only when those anchors are
  absent. `decodeShift` also leaves literal `0x20` spaces alone —
  the new library release emits the occasional in-text literal
  space alongside the encoded `0x05` separator-space, and shifting
  it was corrupting output as `;`.
- The PDF parser now handles RadioReference's non-US layout (e.g.
  Australian MMR system) (issue #278, PR #283). New `siteRowDashRE`
  pattern matches dash-joined `RFSS-Site (X-Y) Name freqs` rows;
  `System Frequencies` and `System Talkgroups` are accepted as
  section markers; `Display` is recognised as an alias for the
  `Alpha Tag` column; `a`-suffix secondary-control-channel
  frequencies are now captured; talkgroup hex columns with leading
  zeros (e.g. `065` for dec=101) are validated numerically rather
  than by string match.
- The `gophertrunk import-pdf` TUI is now usable on systems with
  dozens of sites or hundreds of talkgroups (issue #279, PR #284).
  The Sites tab previously rendered every row unconditionally and
  spilled off-screen; both tabs now paginate to fit the terminal
  height (with a 20-row fallback when `tea.WindowSizeMsg` hasn't
  arrived yet), show a `Site N of M  (showing X-Y)` position
  indicator, and accept `pgup`/`pgdn` for page jumps plus
  `home`/`end` / `g`/`G` to jump to the first/last entry. The
  footer hints are updated.

## [v0.1.6] — 2026-05-18

RTL-SDR driver stabilization release. Eleven merged PRs land
librtlsdr-parity fixes for tuner init bursts, I²C bridge timing,
crystal-frequency selection, macOS IOKit enumeration, and a new
wire-level USB debug-trace switch — layered defenses against the
long-running issue #248 burst-EPIPE reproduction (PRs #255, #256,
#258, #259, #260, #261, #262, #263, #265, #266) plus the macOS
enumeration miss (issue #257, PR #261). Issues #248 and #257
remain open pending field validation on the reporter hardware.
No daemon-level behavior changes outside the RTL-SDR driver.

### Added

- **`RTLSDR_DEBUG_USB=1` environment variable for wire-level debug
  traces.** When set, every USB control transfer the RTL-SDR driver
  issues — `ControlIn`, `ControlOut`, `Reset` — is logged to stderr
  with the bmRequestType, wValue/wIndex/wLength, the payload hex
  (capped at 64 bytes per call), and the outcome (ok / err + duration).
  Output is diffable against `LIBUSB_DEBUG=4` traces from osmocom
  librtlsdr's `rtl_test`, so users can pinpoint exactly which
  transfer stalls on hardware that still misbehaves after the
  librtlsdr-parity fixes. Also emits a per-service trace from the
  macOS IOKit enumerator (matched IOKit class, locationID, VID/PID,
  dropped-property reason) when set — intended for diagnosing
  dongles that don't appear in `sdr list` output. Off by default;
  zero allocation when unset. Documented in the install-linux and
  install-macos troubleshooting tables.

### Changed

- **RTL-SDR tuner I²C bridge now toggles per public method instead of
  per register write.** Every tuner driver (R82xx, E4000, FC0012,
  FC0013, FC2580) previously turned the RTL2832U I²C repeater on
  before each `writeReg`/`readReg` and back off after it — three USB
  control transfers per single-byte chip register access. The
  repeater is now opened once at the top of each public method
  (`Init`, `Standby`, `SetFreq`, `SetBandwidth`, `SetGain`,
  `SetGainMode`) and closed at the end, matching librtlsdr's
  `rtlsdr_set_tuner_*` wrap pattern. For an R820T2 `SetFreq` call
  (~10–15 register writes) this drops 40–60 USB control transfers per
  retune to the steady-state two — measurably faster on USB 2.0 hubs
  and meaningfully less timing-fragile on marginal cabling. Compatible
  with the issue #248 fix: `R82xx.Init`'s leading
  `SetI2CRepeater(true)` is the fresh wire write the chip needs to
  arm the bridge before its multi-byte burst, and the cache state
  ends up `false` post-Detect (off-toggle defer) so the on-toggle
  is real rather than a cache no-op.
- **RTL-SDR tuner detection now follows librtlsdr's exact rtlsdr_open
  probe order and GPIO bring-up dance.** The Go port previously
  probed R820T → R828D → E4000 → FC0013 → FC0012 → FC2580 with no
  GPIO pulses, which silently broke detection of non-R820T tuners
  (FC2580/FC0013/E4000/FC0012) on dongles whose chip-enable lines
  hold the IC in reset until pulsed. The orchestrator now mirrors
  `librtlsdr.c` exactly: R820T → R828D → GPIO5 high→low reset →
  FC2580 → GPIO4 output enable → FC0013 → E4000 → FC0012 (followed by
  a GPIO6 reset pulse if FC0012 was found). FC0012's `Init` also no
  longer emits the two spurious `0x0C` register writes ("soft-reset")
  the pre-fix code shipped — librtlsdr never wrote those; the chip
  reset is the GPIO5 pulse.

### Fixed

- **RTL-SDR R828D-family tuners (RTL-SDR Blog V4 and similar) now
  use the correct 16 MHz reference crystal.** `NewR82xx`
  previously initialized every R820T/R820T2/R828D instance with
  `r.xtalHz = 28_800_000`, the R820T value. R828D variants run
  from a 16 MHz crystal per librtlsdr's `R828D_XTAL_FREQ`. The
  divergence didn't surface during init (the burst uses fixed
  register values), but every `SetFreq` call on an R828D would
  compute PLL parameters against the wrong reference — every
  tuned frequency landed at ~28.8/16 = 1.8× the requested LO,
  rendering V4 dongles unusable for tuning once they did open.
  `NewR82xx` now picks the per-chip default; `SetXtal` keeps
  working as the explicit override for boards with non-standard
  crystals. Closes [issue #264](https://github.com/MattCheramie/GopherTrunk/issues/264)'s
  tuning-after-init half; the init-burst EPIPE half is covered
  by the existing layered defense from issues #248 / PRs
  #258 / #260 / #262 / #263 / #265, which apply to R828D writes
  identically.

- **RTL-SDR R820T burst-init now adds a chip-settle window and
  chunk-size fallback for the EPIPE-on-first-burst case.** Sixth
  iteration on issue #248 after PR #263's per-chunk EPIPE retry +
  open-path USBDEVFS_RESET envelope still failed to close it on two
  NESDR SMArt v5 units. The post-#263 trace confirms the USB reset
  doesn't change the chip's response to the 17-byte burst,
  `Demod.InitBaseband` matches librtlsdr's `rtlsdr_init_baseband`
  byte-for-byte across all 20 register writes + the 20-byte FIR
  upload, the load-bearing `SetI2CRepeater(true)` toggle from PR #262
  is on the wire immediately before each burst attempt, and EP0
  stays healthy post-EPIPE (subsequent control transfers succeed
  without `USBDEVFS_CLEAR_HALT`). Two new defenses ship in this
  round, layered before the existing inner+outer retry from PR #263:
  - `R82xx.Init` now sleeps 5 ms between opening the I²C repeater
    and emitting the burst, covering a chip-settle window librtlsdr
    gets incidentally via function-call latency that our tight
    PrepareDemod → Init back-to-back path doesn't.
  - `writeBurstRaw` now halves the chunk size on
    EPIPE-after-inner-retry-exhausted (16 → 8 → 4 floor) and re-runs
    the whole burst at the smaller size before giving up. Probes the
    chip's effective I²C-bridge FIFO depth empirically — librtlsdr's
    `NMAX_WRITES = 16` may exceed what specific firmware revisions
    accept. The final-failure error wraps as
    `tried chunk sizes 16,8,4; all EPIPE'd: ...` so reporters see
    attribution. Idempotent-write contract called out at the
    function comment — register writes through this path must stay
    safe to replay across the halving walk.
  If this still reproduces, kernel-level usbmon packet traces become
  the prerequisite — `LIBUSB_DEBUG=4` doesn't dump payloads and the
  diagnostic data inferrable from existing traces is exhausted.
  Continues [issue #248](https://github.com/MattCheramie/GopherTrunk/issues/248).

- **RTL-SDR R820T burst-init EPIPE now recovers via a single in-place
  retry + one-shot open-path reset hammer.** Two NESDR SMArt v5 units
  reproduced an EPIPE on the very first `r82xx_init_array` I²C-bridge
  OUT even after PR #262's load-bearing `SetI2CRepeater(true)` wire
  toggle was confirmed firing on the wire (per the post-#262 paired
  `RTLSDR_DEBUG_USB=1` / `LIBUSB_DEBUG=4` capture). The wire bytes
  are byte-identical to librtlsdr's `r82xx_write` first chunk, EP0 is
  not halted (subsequent control transfers succeed without
  `USBDEVFS_CLEAR_HALT`), and `rtl_test` never calls
  `libusb_reset_device` — the EPIPE is a request-specific NACK inside
  the chip, not a USB endpoint state issue.
  `R82xx.writeBurstChunk` now retries a failing chunk once after an
  8 ms settle (no extra repeater toggles — PR #262's contract intact;
  retry attribution is wrapped into the error as
  `after 1 retry on EPIPE: ...` so traces show whether it fired).
  `openDevice` now wraps the entire bring-up sequence (USB warmup →
  baseband init → tuner detect → demod prep → tuner.Init → IF freq)
  in a 1-shot reset+retry envelope on EPIPE / `ErrDeviceGone` —
  subsumes the previous warmup-only retry from PR #255 and extends
  it past the warmup phase. Non-EPIPE errors return immediately
  (reset is the wrong hammer for them). At most one USBDEVFS_RESET
  per `Open` call. `docs/install-linux.md` gains a usbmon
  packet-capture recipe for the next round of diagnostics if this
  doesn't close it — `LIBUSB_DEBUG=4` doesn't dump control-transfer
  payloads, usbmon does. Continues
  [issue #248](https://github.com/MattCheramie/GopherTrunk/issues/248).
- **RTL-SDR `tuners.Detect` again toggles the I²C repeater off on
  return.** An earlier change in this cycle had Detect leave the
  repeater ON across the tuner bring-up window under the theory
  that the wire toggle was a wasteful divergence from librtlsdr.
  Empirically on NESDR v5 silicon the toggle is load-bearing —
  even though the demod register already holds the on-value, the
  chip needs the fresh write to arm the I²C bridge for the next
  multi-byte burst. `R82xx.writeBurstRaw`'s leading
  `SetI2CRepeater(true)` is now a real wire write again (cache=false
  on entry post-Detect), matching librtlsdr's `rtlsdr_open` flow.
  The `PrepareDemod` sequence shipped earlier this cycle is
  unchanged — it remains independently correct librtlsdr-parity
  work that runs after Detect's off-toggle and before the tuner
  burst. Re-closes
  [issue #248](https://github.com/MattCheramie/GopherTrunk/issues/248)
  after the user retest showed the EPIPE persisting.

- **RTL-SDR enumeration on macOS now matches both legacy
  `IOUSBDevice` and modern `IOUSBHostDevice` IOKit classes.** The
  macOS USB enumerator previously matched only `IOUSBDevice`, which
  yields zero services on some Apple Silicon + macOS combinations
  where Apple's IOUSBFamily compatibility bridge is a no-op.
  `gophertrunk sdr list` returned an empty slice with no error and
  no diagnostic — dongles that worked fine in SDRTrunk, GQRX, and
  Homebrew `lsusb` were invisible to GopherTrunk. Both IOKit
  classes are now matched and their results unioned (deduplicated
  by IOKit `locationID`) in both `List` and `Open`. Closes
  [issue #257](https://github.com/MattCheramie/GopherTrunk/issues/257).

- **RTL-SDR open path now matches librtlsdr's R820T/R828D demod-prep
  sequence between `detect_tuner` and `tuner->init`.** The previous
  flow ran `tuners.Detect` (which toggled the I²C repeater off on
  return), then `tuner.Init`, then a generic `SetIFFreq` — skipping
  four demod-register writes librtlsdr emits before tuner init:
  disable Zero-IF mode (page 1, addr 0xB1, val 0x1A), enable
  In-phase ADC input only (page 0, addr 0x08, val 0x4D),
  `set_if_freq(3.57 MHz)`, and enable spectrum inversion (page 1,
  addr 0x15, val 0x01). Without those four writes the R820T-family
  chip is brought up against a Zero-IF / IQ datapath / inversion
  configuration that diverges from what librtlsdr ships, which has
  been the residual divergence after the chunking fix shipped in
  this cycle. New `R82xx.PrepareDemod` runs the sequence; `openDevice`
  invokes it on the R820T-family branch.
- **RTL-SDR `tuners.Detect` now leaves the I²C repeater on across the
  tuner bring-up window.** Previously Detect deferred
  `SetI2CRepeater(false)` and tuner.Init then re-enabled the repeater
  per burst, producing an off→on toggle between Detect and the very
  first I²C OUT — the wire byte right before the multi-byte burst
  that some NESDR v5 dongles stall on. Detect now leaves the
  repeater on on success (or toggles it off on the no-tuner
  error path); the new `openDevice` step list owns the post-Init
  off toggle.
- **RTL-SDR R820T/R820T2 manual gain now uses librtlsdr's balanced
  LNA+Mixer split.** `R82xx.SetGain` previously walked the LNA gain
  ladder to maximum-not-exceeding-target, then walked the mixer
  ladder — landing on the same numeric gain as librtlsdr but with all
  the gain concentrated on the LNA. The result was a worse noise
  figure and worse front-end linearity at every ladder entry. The
  walk now alternates LNA and mixer with pre-increment, matching
  `r82xx_set_gain` in osmocom librtlsdr. Affects every R820T/R820T2
  dongle (the common case) the moment the user picks a manual gain.
- **RTL-SDR E4000 (Elonics) tuner frequency setting now writes the
  correct synthesizer registers.** `E4000.SetFreq` was writing the
  fractional `X` value to `SYNTH5`/`SYNTH6` (off-by-one register) and
  never writing the band-select / R-divider byte to `SYNTH7` at all,
  so the chip would mistune at every frequency. The PLL math itself
  was correct; only the wire-level register addresses were wrong.
  Now matches librtlsdr's `e4k_tune_params` exactly. Affects E4000
  dongles (legacy hardware — NOXON DAB sticks and similar).
- **RTL-SDR R820T/R820T2 init burst now chunks at 16 bytes to match
  librtlsdr.** The 27-byte register flood at the top of `R82xx.Init`
  previously went on the wire as a single 28-byte I²C-bridge OUT
  (1 register pointer + 27 data bytes). Some NESDR v5 dongles stall
  the very first multi-byte OUT when its data payload exceeds 16
  bytes — librtlsdr's `r82xx_write` has chunked at `NMAX_WRITES = 16`
  for exactly this reason. `writeBurstRaw` now splits the data into
  ≤16-byte segments under one repeater on/off pair, advancing the
  register pointer per chunk (the chip auto-increments). The wire
  bytes are otherwise unchanged.
  Follow-up to the warmup probe shipped earlier in this cycle;
  addresses the residual reproduction in
  [issue #248](https://github.com/MattCheramie/GopherTrunk/issues/248).
- **RTL-SDR tuner init no longer fails on dongles left in a
  half-initialised USB state.** Open now performs librtlsdr's
  dummy-write probe (`USB_SYSCTL = 0x09`) immediately after claiming
  the interface and, on `EPIPE` / `ErrDeviceGone`, runs a one-shot
  `USBDEVFS_RESET` + re-claim before retrying. Dongles whose endpoint
  was left stalled by a crashed prior session or a freshly-unbound
  DVB kernel driver now open transparently instead of surfacing the
  EPIPE as "r82xx init: burst write: I2CWrite addr=0x34: broken pipe".
  When both attempts fail the existing tuner-bringup hint is still
  appended.
  Addresses [issue #248](https://github.com/MattCheramie/GopherTrunk/issues/248).

## [v0.1.5] — 2026-05-16

### Added

- **Remediation hint on tuner-init I²C failures.** The RTL-SDR
  driver now appends a one-line hint pointing at the three known
  root causes (DVB kernel driver still bound, marginal USB power,
  flaky cable / USB 3.0 hub) when the tuner doesn't ack on the I²C
  bus during bring-up — both the EPIPE-on-first-burst case and the
  mid-init `ErrDeviceGone` case. `docs/install-linux.md`'s
  troubleshooting table grows a matching row keyed on the literal
  error string so operators searching for "broken pipe" land
  somewhere actionable.
  Shipped in [PR #251](https://github.com/MattCheramie/GopherTrunk/pull/251),
  addressing [issue #248](https://github.com/MattCheramie/GopherTrunk/issues/248).
- **Bundled Zadig WinUSB driver installer in the Windows installer.**
  The Windows `setup.exe` now ships `zadig.exe` alongside
  `gophertrunk.exe`, so first-run operators no longer have to chase a
  separate download to bind the RTL-SDR's WinUSB driver. Setup adds a
  Start Menu shortcut **"Install RTL-SDR driver (Zadig)"** and offers
  an unchecked **"Run Zadig now"** option on the final wizard page;
  Zadig's own manifest handles the UAC elevation. The uninstaller
  also now strips the `{app}` entry from the system PATH (previously
  leaked across uninstalls) and asks whether to wipe the editable
  `config.yaml` + the Setup-created `gophertrunk-web` subfolder —
  default **No**, so user data is preserved unless explicitly opted
  in. Bundled binary is `zadig-2.9.exe` from libwdi `v1.5.1`
  (GPL-3.0); see [`THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`](THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md)
  for attribution.
  Shipped in [PR #249](https://github.com/MattCheramie/GopherTrunk/pull/249).
- **NXDN deviation surfaces on the TUI Settings → FEC tab.**
  The `nxdn_deviation_hz` knob shipped in [PR #243](https://github.com/MattCheramie/GopherTrunk/pull/243)
  but wasn't visible from the operator console. The
  per-system FEC summary now appends `deviation: 1800 Hz`
  (or whatever override is configured) alongside the existing
  `viterbi:` mode, matching the pattern P25 Phase 2 / MPT 1327
  use for their per-protocol opt-outs. The hash gate that
  controls FEC table refresh covers the new field so a
  config-reloaded override surfaces inside one SSE round-trip.
- **NXDN real-air integration harness skeleton.**
  [`cmd/gophertrunk/integration_cc_nxdn_realair_test.go`](cmd/gophertrunk/integration_cc_nxdn_realair_test.go)
  is the skip-gated companion to the existing synthesized
  `TestDaemonCCDecodesNXDN`. When a contributor drops a single
  `*.cfile` + sibling `*.metadata.json` pair into
  [`samples/nxdn/`](samples/nxdn/), the harness:
   - registers the in-tree `sdr.MockFloat32Driver` against the
     capture,
   - tunes the daemon to `metadata.center_freq_hz` at
     `metadata.sample_rate_hz` (both required at the top level
     since GNU Radio cfiles don't embed them),
   - boots the daemon with `nxdn_viterbi_mode: spec`,
   - waits up to 3 s wall time for `events.KindCCLocked`,
   - asserts `LockState.SystemID` / `SiteID` / `FrequencyHz`
     match the documented `metadata.expected` values
     byte-for-byte.
  
  CI stays green via a documented `t.Skipf` fall-through until
  a capture lands. Multiple `*.cfile` candidates surface as an
  explicit test error so the contributor knows to disambiguate.
  Metadata schema documented in
  [`samples/nxdn/README.md`](samples/nxdn/README.md).

- **Per-system NXDN deviation tunability** (`nxdn_deviation_hz`).
  The NXDN receiver's 4-FSK slicer was hardcoded to the Common Air
  Interface spec value of 1800 Hz peak deviation, which produces a
  bimodal dibit distribution on captures from transmitters that
  deviate from spec (e.g. `samples/nxdn/NXDN96 IQ.wav` reports
  3 / 50 / 3 / 44 % through the production pipeline). Operators can
  now set `nxdn_deviation_hz: 2400` (or any positive value) on a
  per-system basis to recalibrate the slicer against the captured
  signal's actual deviation. Zero / unset keeps the spec default.
  See [`samples/nxdn/README.md`](samples/nxdn/README.md#tuning-deviation-for-non-spec-captures)
  for the sweep recipe.
- **AMBE+2 knox preset bundles** (`ambe2.RegisterPreset` /
  `ambe2.ListPresets`). The existing `SetKnoxTone` hook (b₁ ∈
  [144, 163]) registers one vendor-specific dual-tone pair at a
  time; the new preset API takes a named bundle of entries and
  records the preset name for operator diagnostics. Lets per-vendor
  sub-packages ship curated tables via a single `RegisterPreset`
  call instead of repeated `SetKnoxTone`s. The in-tree code ships
  no vendor presets because the public AMBE+2 spec does not
  document the [144, 163] frequency range — see
  [`docs/vocoders.md`](docs/vocoders.md#sourcing-vendor-frequencies)
  for the sourcing checklist.

### Internal

- **Polish pass: config example completeness, YSF acceptance criteria,
  tuner math coverage.**
  - `config.example.yaml` now shows commented examples for every
    per-system FEC opt-out documented in the README's
    [§FEC opt-outs](https://github.com/MattCheramie/GopherTrunk#fec-opt-outs)
    table. NXDN (`nxdn_viterbi_mode`, `nxdn_deviation_hz`), P25
    Phase 2 (`p25_phase2_{trellis,rs,scrambler,clock}_mode`),
    TETRA (`tetra_colour_code`, `tetra_channel`,
    `tetra_channel_coding`, `tetra_clock_mode`), EDACS
    (`edacs_bch_mode`), MPT 1327 (`mpt1327_bch_mode`,
    `mpt1327_cwsc_tolerance`), and D-STAR (`dstar_fec_mode`)
    previously had docs but no example block to copy from.
  - `samples/ysf/README.md` grows the explicit
    `## Acceptance criteria` section the other four sample
    READMEs (`nxdn`, `dmr-tier2`, `mpt1327`, `tetra`) already
    have. Three numbered criteria — CRC pass-through against the
    metadata's `fich_sequence`, MMDVMHost-vs-DSDcc schedule
    locked, and trellis correction-depth bounded ≤ 4 errors per
    100-bit on-air block at SNR ≥ 12 dB.
  - `internal/sdr/rtlsdr/tuners` coverage rises from 30.3% to
    43.5% via ten new tests covering: E4000 PLL Σ-Δ synth math
    (hand-computed Z / X for 50 MHz / 100 MHz / 433 MHz / 868 MHz
    / 1.5 GHz against the band-table walk in `e4k.go:84-97`),
    `ErrUnsupportedFreq` exact-boundary inclusivity for E4000 /
    FC0012 / FC0013 / FC2580 (the production `< minHz || > maxHz`
    guard accepts the endpoints), `nearestGainIndex` rounding
    behaviour on E4000's 17-step LNA ladder + the shared helper's
    clamp / tie-break invariants, and `fc0012NearestGainIndex`
    rounding parity. No production-code changes — pure post-hoc
    coverage of math paths that don't need RTL-SDR hardware.

- **DVSI mock-transport error-path coverage.** The
  `internal/voice/dvsi` test suite previously exercised the happy
  paths (scripted exchange, loopback silence, ErrNoDevice fall-
  through) but left the error-wrapping branches uncovered.
  Fifteen new tests now lock in: `Open(DefaultOptions())` returns
  `ErrNoDevice` carrying VID/PID/serial diagnostics, zero-valued
  VID/PID falls back to the documented FT2232H defaults, explicit
  `Transport` beats `LoopbackOnly` in `Open`'s switch, `Decode`
  wraps `transport.Write` / `transport.Read` errors with their
  origin labels, the loopback `Transport` rejects `Read` before
  `Write` + `Write`/`Read` after `Close` + malformed packets,
  and `PktControl` / unknown-type packets get cleanly Ack-mirrored
  so a future fuzz target won't stall on them. Hardware
  integration unchanged — `openUSBTransport` still returns
  `ErrNoDevice` until a chip is available for round-trip
  testing.

- **Calibrate harness math is testable without external fixtures.**
  Extracted `calibrate.CompareSamples([]int16, []int16) Result` so
  the RMS-ratio + cross-correlation math can be exercised on
  synthetic streams. The two existing skip-gated tests
  (`TestCompareIMBE*`, `TestCompareAMBE2*`) keep waiting for
  captured DSD-FME / OP25 reference WAVs; the new
  `TestCompareSamplesSyntheticGainOffset` validates the math
  unconditionally (a +3 dB louder reference must produce
  `RMSRatioDb = −3.0 ± 0.5` and `PeakXcorr ≥ 0.99`). Regressions
  in the loudness / similarity math now fail CI without needing
  any external reference data to land first.

- **Cleanup & coverage round.**
  - `web/scripts/seal-node-modules.mjs` is registered as the npm
    `postinstall` hook. It drops a sentinel `web/node_modules/go.mod`
    so Go's recursive package discovery (`go list ./...`,
    `go test ./...`) skips the stray Go packages npm dependencies
    occasionally ship inside their tarballs (e.g.
    `flatted/golang/pkg/flatted`). No more spurious entries in Go
    package listings on developer machines that have run
    `npm install`.
  - `cmd/gophertrunk/launcher.go` grows three injectable seams
    (`hasWebAssetsFn`, `canOpenBrowserFn`, `openBrowserFn`) so
    `openWebUI` can be exercised end-to-end without spawning a real
    browser. New tests verify the embedded-SPA branch wins when
    `gtweb.HasAssets()` returns true, the headless-fallback prints
    instead of launching, the no-embed sibling-discovery path runs
    cleanly, and the missing-HTTP-addr error fires.
  - `watchReloadSignal` now installs `signal.Notify` synchronously
    before spawning its goroutine — fixes a latent race where
    SIGHUP delivered immediately after the call could kill the
    process (default SIGHUP action) before the goroutine got
    around to registering its handler. Visible only in tightly-
    timed tests; harmless in production where SIGHUP arrives long
    after startup.
  - New `TestSIGHUP_TriggersReload` and
    `TestSIGHUP_BadConfigDoesNotCrash` send real SIGHUP signals to
    the test process and assert the watcher's reload path runs and
    that malformed-YAML reloads leave the in-memory config intact.

- **Test infrastructure: web SPA + in-process TUI.**
  - SPA gains Vitest + React Testing Library. `Import.test.tsx`
    covers the no-config / no-mutations banners + the
    Stage→Preview→Result happy path + commit / discard / error
    flows; `Settings.test.tsx` covers the inline-edit state
    machine, client-side validation, server PATCH errors, and
    restart-required badges. Run with `npm test`.
  - The in-process TUI launcher path (`runInProcessTUI`) is split
    into a testable `prepareInProcessTUI` (URL resolve, log
    redirect, model construction) and a thin `prog.Run()` wrapper.
    New tests cover missing-HTTP-addr error, log-redirect
    correctness, cleanup restoring the original writer, the
    constructed client actually reaching the daemon, plus a
    teatest-driven smoke test of the bubbletea Update loop against
    a stub HTTP daemon.
  - `internal/api.Server` now exposes `BoundAddr()`, and
    `Daemon.HTTPListenAddr()` prefers the actually-bound address
    when the listener has resolved an ephemeral `:0` port. Fixes
    a long-standing bug in the `HTTPListenAddr` docstring claim
    "helpful for tests using an ephemeral `:0` port" — it really
    is now.

### Added

- **Interactive daemon launcher.** `gophertrunk` (no args) now prompts
  the operator on a TTY for what to drive: `[1]` in-process TUI, `[2]`
  bundled web SPA in the system browser, or `[3]` stay headless.
  Non-TTY stdin (systemd, Windows service, Docker) auto-selects
  headless so service managers see no behaviour change. New flags
  preselect: `-tui`, `-web`, `-headless`; the three are mutually
  exclusive. See [`docs/launcher.md`](docs/launcher.md).
- **Live settings editing.** New `PATCH /api/v1/settings` endpoint
  accepts a sparse patch (every field optional), writes the result to
  `config.yaml` preserving comments + formatting, and hot-reloads the
  fields the daemon knows how to change in-process (audio volume /
  mute / recording, scanner scan mode, log level). Other fields
  ("restart required") are written to disk and flagged in the
  response so the SPA / TUI can render badges. An mtime guard refuses
  to clobber a config.yaml that was edited externally while the
  daemon was running.
- **Live import.** New `POST /api/v1/import` (multipart),
  `POST /api/v1/import/{id}/commit`, `DELETE /api/v1/import/{id}`
  endpoints let operators upload RadioReference PDFs / multi-section
  CSVs to a running daemon, preview the parsed systems, and commit
  into `config.yaml` without restarting. The TUI grows an Import
  panel (Stage → Preview → Result); the web SPA grows a matching
  `/import` route with a native file picker.
- **Startup hardening.** A new pre-flight step auto-creates the
  recordings / storage / cc-cache parent dirs and verifies TLS
  cert/key parse cleanly before the daemon binds. SDR-pool open
  failures and missing talkgroup CSVs collect into `startup_warnings`
  (surfaced on the runtime DTO + the launcher menu) instead of
  vanishing into the log. HTTP and gRPC bind failures now abort the
  daemon cleanly instead of being demoted to warnings — the launcher
  never lands against a half-dead daemon.
- **Embedded web SPA.** The daemon binary now embeds the built SPA
  (when `make web-build` was run before `go build`) and serves it
  at `/` on the HTTP API. `gophertrunk -web` opens the daemon URL
  directly; client-side routes (`/scanner`, `/settings`, `/import`,
  …) fall back to `index.html` so React-Router takes over. Fresh
  checkouts without a `web/dist/` build keep the existing sibling-
  directory discovery path. See [`docs/web.md`](docs/web.md).
- **Inline-editable Settings.** Every editable runtime knob the
  daemon hot-reloads (audio volume / mute, log level, scanner scan
  mode, …) plus the restart-required ones are now editable from
  both the TUI Settings panel (cursor + Enter to edit, Enter to
  save, Esc to cancel) and the web SPA's `/settings` route. Rows
  show a `[restart]` badge when the daemon can't hot-apply.
- **SIGHUP config reload.** Sending `SIGHUP` to a running daemon
  reloads `config.yaml`, diff-applies hot-reloadable fields, and
  logs a list of restart-required changes. The signal handler is a
  no-op on Windows.
- **Single-instance lock.** The daemon now flocks
  `<configdir>/.gophertrunk.lock` at startup so two instances aimed
  at the same `config.yaml` can't both try to claim the same
  RTL-SDR devices. The contender exits with a clear "another
  gophertrunk is running (pid=…, started=…)" message instead of an
  opaque libusb error.
- **Friendlier YAML errors.** `config: <path>: parse error …` now
  carries the resolved config path and a hint to run the wizard or
  recheck indentation.
- **Patent-posture notice plumbed through `startup_warnings`.**
  The AMBE+2 advisory no longer scrolls past on the daemon log
  immediately before the launcher prompt; it lands in the warnings
  channel and surfaces on the launcher menu / TUI dashboard / runtime
  DTO. `GOPHERTRUNK_QUIET_BANNER=1` still suppresses it for CI.

### Changed

- **Security defaults flipped for closed-LAN deployments.** Empty
  `api.auth.mode` now defaults to `disabled` (was `auto`) and empty
  `api.cors.allowed_origins` now permits any origin (was strict). The
  daemon still warns loudly at startup when these defaults take
  effect on a non-loopback bind, but the common single-host setup no
  longer needs explicit auth + CORS config to talk to the web SPA
  from `file://`. Operators on hostile networks opt back in via
  explicit `api.auth.mode: required` + `api.cors.allowed_origins:
  ["http://laptop.local:5173"]`. The default `api.http_addr` is now
  `127.0.0.1:8080` (was empty) so the bundled launcher's TUI / web
  paths work out of the box.

- **Config auto-discovery.** `gophertrunk run` (no `-config` flag)
  now walks `$GOPHERTRUNK_CONFIG` → `<UserConfigDir>/GopherTrunk/config.yaml`
  → `<Home>/Documents/GopherTrunk/config.yaml` → `./config.yaml`
  and loads the first match, printing `config: loaded <path>` on
  startup. When the chosen directory holds 2+ `*.yaml`/`*.yml`
  files, an interactive numbered picker prompts the operator on
  stdin (non-TTY launches like Windows services / systemd / CI
  auto-select the first match with a stderr warning instead of
  hanging). `internal/config.Discover()` + `DiscoverWith(opts)` for
  programmatic callers.
- **Windows installer "editable-files folder" page.** The Inno
  Setup wizard now asks where the operator's `config.yaml` should
  live (default `Documents\GopherTrunk`), seeds a starter file
  there (preserved across re-install + uninstall), pins
  `HKCU\Environment\GOPHERTRUNK_CONFIG` so the daemon finds it
  without `-config`, and adds a Start Menu shortcut "Edit my
  config.yaml (Notepad)". See [`install-windows.md`](docs/install-windows.md).
- **`gophertrunk sdr list --probe`** opens each enumerated device
  long enough to run the demod + tuner bring-up, populating the
  TUNER + gains columns. Without the flag those columns stay
  blank (Enumerate only reads USB descriptors, so the command is
  fast and never collides with a running daemon).
- **Config-builder wizard quality-of-life.** `←` / `→` toggles
  boolean fields (the footer hint already promised this). The
  path field expands `%VAR%` (Windows), `$VAR` / `${VAR}` (POSIX),
  and leading `~` at write time; the review screen shows
  "resolves to: \<abs\>" when expansion changes the path. The
  default write target now consults `$GOPHERTRUNK_CONFIG` and
  falls back to `<UserConfigDir>/GopherTrunk/config.yaml` when
  the current directory isn't writable (fixes "Access is denied"
  when the binary is launched from `C:\Program Files\GopherTrunk\`).
  `MkdirAll` errors on commit are surfaced instead of swallowed.
- `gophertrunk import-pdf` subcommand parses trunking-system data
  from RadioReference.com PDF exports **and** from structured
  multi-section CSV bundles, merging both into the operator's
  `config.yaml` plus per-system Trunk-Recorder-style talkgroup CSVs.
  Launches a Bubbletea TUI by default for reviewing/pruning sites and
  toggling per-talkgroup Scan/Lockout/Priority before write;
  `-no-tui`/`-dry-run`/`-force` flags cover scripting and CI bring-up.
  PDF and CSV sources are mixable in a single invocation (`-pdf` and
  `-csv` are both repeatable). Atomic writes (in-memory schema
  validation + temp file + rename) so a malformed source never
  corrupts the existing config. Supports P25 Phase 1 + Phase 2 PDFs;
  CSV bundles cover P25/DMR/NXDN. See
  [`docs/import.md`](docs/import.md) for the full operator reference
  and CSV format spec.
- Capture-spec **acceptance criteria** for every real-air-blocked
  follow-up at [`samples/<proto>/README.md`](samples/): TETRA
  wants 5 s lock latency + ≥ 90% frame recovery + a new
  `gophertrunk_tetra_viterbi_corrections` Prometheus histogram
  (gated by `metrics.detailed_fec: true`, not yet wired); NXDN
  wants ≥ 80% CRC-verified CAC bursts + SystemID match + 3 s
  lock; DMR Tier II wants byte-for-byte FLC match + clean
  Terminator-with-LC handling; MPT 1327 wants ≥ 95% true-positive
  lock rate + monotone tolerance sweep. [`samples/README.md`](samples/README.md)'s
  top-level table now shows status (✅ closed vs ⏳ capture
  pending) plus per-protocol "what captures buy" — DMR Tier II
  and MPT 1327 captures are optional secondary validation rather
  than the blocker (closed algorithmically in PR-A / PR-C).
- `internal/version` now exposes `Version`, `Commit`, and
  `BuildTime` (all `-ldflags`-injectable) plus a `String()`
  formatter (`"vX.Y.Z (sha=…, built=…)"`). Makefile and the
  release workflow both populate all three. `gophertrunk version`
  CLI subcommand prints the formatted string; the daemon logs it
  on startup.
- AMBE+2 patent-posture banner: daemon logs a one-line notice at
  startup pointing operators at
  [`docs/vocoders.md`](docs/vocoders.md). Suppressible via
  `GOPHERTRUNK_QUIET_BANNER=1` for CI / test harnesses.
- `make release-dry-run VERSION=v0.99.0` rehearses the release
  build locally — produces a `dist/dry-run/gophertrunk` with the
  supplied version metadata injected and a `SHA256SUMS` file.
  See [`CONTRIBUTING.md` §"Cutting a release"](CONTRIBUTING.md#cutting-a-release).
- Toolchain pinned to Go 1.25.10 (closes 23 stdlib CVEs in the
  default 1.25.0 toolchain auto-downloaded by `go 1.25.0` in
  go.mod).
- CI hardening: `vulncheck` job runs `govulncheck` against the
  direct + transitive dependency graph; `licenses` job regenerates
  the transitive-deps inventory via `google/go-licenses` and
  diffs against the committed `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.csv`;
  `integration` job runs `make test-integration` across the whole
  module to backstop the existing `cmd/gophertrunk/`-only target.
- `Makefile` targets: `make vulncheck`, `make licenses`,
  `make test-integration`.
- [`THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`](THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md) — hand-
  curated direct-deps license table sourced from `go.mod` plus the
  ISC attribution for the mbelib-derived AMBE+2 / IMBE codebook
  tables.
- `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and a systemd unit template
  ([`docs/gophertrunk.service`](docs/gophertrunk.service)) for
  operators standing the daemon up on Linux servers.
- Optional TLS on both the HTTP API and the gRPC server via
  `api.tls_cert` / `api.tls_key` in `config.yaml`. Plain TCP
  stays the default for loopback / trusted-LAN deployments. See
  [`docs/hardening.md` §"Transport encryption (TLS)"](docs/hardening.md#transport-encryption-tls).
- Extended `GET /api/v1/health` diagnostics:
  `pool_attached_count`, `active_calls`, `db_connected`,
  `metrics_enabled`, `auth_mode`, `version` alongside the legacy
  `status` + `now`. Supports k8s / Nomad readiness probes that
  distinguish "process up" from "actually working".
- HTTP server now sets `ReadTimeout` (30 s), `WriteTimeout`
  (30 s), and `IdleTimeout` (120 s) on top of the existing
  `ReadHeaderTimeout`. Streaming endpoints (SSE, audio stream)
  opt out per-request via
  `http.ResponseController.SetWriteDeadline(time.Time{})`.
- gRPC server now configures `keepalive.ServerParameters`
  (30 s idle ping, 10 s ack timeout) +
  `KeepaliveEnforcementPolicy` (5 s min-time floor,
  `PermitWithoutStream: true`) so long-lived `StreamAudio`
  subscribers detect dead peers cleanly.
- Graceful shutdown drain window for the HTTP server bumped from
  5 s to 30 s so in-flight SSE / WebSocket / audio subscribers
  drain instead of being torn down mid-frame.
- AMBE+2 knox / call-alert dual-tone vendor-override hook:
  [`ambe2.SetKnoxTone`](internal/voice/ambe2/knox.go). Operators
  with a per-vendor reference register
  `(freqA, freqB)` pairs for `b1 ∈ [144, 163]` and the matching
  tone frames synthesise through the same DTMF dual-tone path
  (phase-continuous + AGC-scaled).
- Voice calibration plumbing:
  [`cmd/voice-calibrate`](cmd/voice-calibrate/) CLI wrapping
  `calibrate.Compare`, per-vocoder testdata READMEs, and an
  end-to-end recipe at
  [`docs/voice-calibration.md`](docs/voice-calibration.md).
- DVSI USB-3000 / AMBE-3003 hardware backend scaffolding behind
  `-tags dvsi`. AMBE-3003 wire protocol + `Vocoder` + `Transport`
  interface + `voice.Vocoder` conformance + `init()`
  registration all ship; the USB / FTDI plumbing remains a stub
  returning `ErrNoDevice` (hardware integration follows when a
  chip is available for round-trip testing). Loopback `Transport`
  exercises the wire protocol + Vocoder state machine in CI.
- YSF FICH on-air codec: `EncodeFICHOnAir` / `DecodeFICHOnAir`
  in [`internal/radio/ysf/fich_trellis.go`](internal/radio/ysf/fich_trellis.go)
  per the MMDVMHost / DSDcc / Pi-Star reference (puncture
  positions `{0, 1, 102, 103}` + column-major 10×10 interleave).
  Exhaustive single-bit-flip recovery test confirms every one of
  the 100 on-air positions is Viterbi-corrected.
- DMR Tier II / Tier III symbol-density diagnostic test pair in
  [`cmd/gophertrunk/dmr_tier2_diagnostic_test.go`](cmd/gophertrunk/dmr_tier2_diagnostic_test.go)
  that localises the divergent statistic between the two
  synthesized fixtures.
- MPT 1327 CWSC Hamming-distance tolerance via the new
  `mpt1327_cwsc_tolerance` per-system config key. Default value
  is `2` (matches commercial MPT 1327 receivers on noisy on-air
  captures); operators replaying pre-stripped synthesized
  fixtures opt back into exact-match with `0`.

### Changed

- DMR Tier II pipeline `ClockGain` lowered from 0.025 to 0.015
  in [`internal/scanner/ccdecoder/pipelines.go`](internal/scanner/ccdecoder/pipelines.go)'s
  `newDMRTier2Pipeline`. The diagnostic test above surfaced that
  Tier II's BPTC(196, 96)-encoded payload's class-3 dibit
  overrepresentation (21.4% vs Tier III's 5.1%) and matching
  mean-transition magnitude (1.27 vs 0.90) slipped the
  Mueller-Müller clock loop at 0.025. The more conservative gain
  stays locked under the harder symbol distribution; live
  captures benefit equally. Lifts the
  `TestDaemonCCDecodesDMRTier2` `t.Skip` that's been in place
  since PR #184.

### Fixed

- `TestDaemonCCDecodesDMRTier2` no longer skips — see the
  Tier II ClockGain change above.

### Documentation

- New: [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md), [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md),
  [`docs/voice-calibration.md`](docs/voice-calibration.md),
  [`docs/gophertrunk.service`](docs/gophertrunk.service).
- Extended: [`docs/hardening.md`](docs/hardening.md) gains
  "Transport encryption (TLS)", "Health endpoint diagnostics",
  "Connection-drain window", and "Timeouts and keep-alive"
  sections.
- Extended: [`docs/vocoders.md`](docs/vocoders.md) gains
  "Voice calibration plumbing", "Knox / call-alert extension
  hook", and "DVSI backend layout" sections.
- Updated: README's `Status & known gaps` and `Roadmap`
  sections — MPT 1327 CWSC, DMR Tier II fixture, YSF on-air
  codec, and vocoder calibration plumbing all moved from
  "remaining follow-up" to "now shipping" or "real-air capture
  pending".
