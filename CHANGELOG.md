## [Unreleased]

## [v0.3.8] — 2026-06-10

This release adds a pure-Go **LoRa / LoRaWAN receiver** (#586) and hardens the
daemon and several hardware paths. One SDR is channelized into parallel LoRa
sub-channels and decoded through the full PHY (dechirp/FFT, Gray/de-interleave/
Hamming FEC, de-whitening, CRC) with SF7–SF12 auto-detection; LoRaWAN 1.0.x
frames are MAC-decoded and, with operator session keys, MIC-verified and
decrypted, persisted to `lora_log`, served at `GET /api/v1/lora/frames`, and
rendered on a new `/lora` panel. Recording gains an opt-in
`recordings.skip_encrypted` flag (#607). The daemon **never stops silently**
anymore — component panics are recovered and logged, and a soft memory limit
plus a runtime heartbeat bound and surface the process footprint (#606, #492).
On the fix side: P25 IMBE female-voice intelligibility and a high-pitched
recording onset (#605), Airspy USB initialisation (#454), HackRF
interface-claim on macOS (#511), live-audio playback in Chrome via Web Audio
(#598), and the symbol-domain scopes now default to the control SDR (#402).

### Added

- **Skip recording encrypted calls** (#607). A new opt-in
  `recordings.skip_encrypted` flag suppresses WAV/raw files for calls the
  operator can't decode (default `false` keeps recording everything; the call
  log still notes encryption). The recorder gates at call start when a
  control-channel grant already flags encryption (P25 Phase 1, DMR, NXDN,
  EDACS, TETRA), and mid-call when encryption only surfaces on the traffic
  channel (P25 Phase 1 LDU2 Encryption Sync, or a P25 Phase 2 compressed
  grant) — the in-progress files are closed and deleted and no `CallComplete`
  is published, so the partial never reaches the upload feeds. Wired through
  the YAML config, the settings PATCH API + YAML writer, the TUI settings
  panel, and the web Config Builder.
- **LoRa decoding** (#586). A new pure-Go, zero-CGO LoRa receiver decodes the
  LoRa physical layer (chirp dechirp/FFT demodulation, preamble/sync/SFD
  acquisition with carrier-offset and timing recovery, Gray/de-interleave/
  Hamming FEC, de-whitening and CRC) with spreading-factor auto-detection
  across SF7–SF12 and bandwidths 125/250/500 kHz. One SDR is split into
  several parallel LoRa sub-channels via the tuner channelizer/DDC bank.
  LoRaWAN 1.0.x frames are MAC-decoded and, when operator session keys are
  supplied, the MIC is verified and the payload decrypted (no key recovery).
  Configure under `lora.channels`; decoded frames persist to the `lora_log`
  table, are served at `GET /api/v1/lora/frames`, and render live on the new
  `/lora` web panel.

### Changed

- **Daemon never stops silently + bounded memory footprint** (#606, #492). A
  live run could halt mid-decode with no shutdown/fatal/panic line — the
  hallmark of an external SIGKILL (OS memory-pressure killer) or an unrecovered
  goroutine panic. The daemon now installs a deferred `log.Recover()` panic
  guard on the component spawn path, the daemon-run and IQ-capture goroutines,
  the rtltcp reader, the iqtap fanout, and all four composer voice chains, so a
  panic becomes a logged ERROR + clean shutdown instead of a process kill. A
  soft memory limit is set at startup (`GOMEMLIMIT` → `diagnostics.memory_limit_mb`
  → ~70 % of physical RAM), a periodic runtime heartbeat
  (`diagnostics.heartbeat_seconds`, default 60 s) logs uptime/goroutines/heap so
  a leak or pre-kill footprint is visible in the timeline, and `net/http/pprof`
  is available behind `GOPHERTRUNK_PPROF`.

### Fixed

- **P25 IMBE female-voice intelligibility + high-pitched recording onset.**
  Follow-up to the §6.3 voiced-phase regeneration (#600). Two corrections to
  match the reference imbe_vocoder/mbelib so female (high-pitch, mostly-voiced)
  speech is no longer rendered as noise:
  - The dispersion is now a **bounded per-frame offset on a coherent phase
    memory** (`PHIl = PSIl + offset`) instead of a full `[−π,π)` step
    *accumulated* into the phase memory every frame. The old random walk
    decorrelated the upper harmonics into noise within a few frames; a
    confound-free A/B on a sustained 220 Hz vowel shows the reference model is
    ~12 % more periodic/harmonic.
  - The offset magnitude is **scaled by the unvoiced-harmonic fraction**
    (`numUv/L`), so a mostly-voiced frame gets near-zero dispersion (stays
    intelligible) while noise-dominated frames still de-buzz. Fully-voiced
    frames are now synthesized coherently, as in the reference.
  - The **idle-carrier mute now engages on the first frame at a transmission
    onset** instead of leaking one ~352 Hz buzz frame. ~60 % of field calls
    opened with that leaked frame — the "highly pitched beginning" a user
    reported (worse on CQPSK, whose warm-up is longer). The run-threshold guard
    that protects a lone idle frame *inside* speech is unchanged.
- **Airspy device initialisation** (#454). The pure-Go Airspy driver's USB
  vendor request opcodes were systematically wrong; they now match libairspy's
  `airspy_commands` enum (`SET_SAMPLERATE`=12, `GET_SAMPLERATES`=25, gain/freq
  opcodes, …). `SetSampleRate` is now a vendor-IN transfer with the rate carried
  in `wIndex` (the firmware NAK'd the previous vendor-OUT, surfacing as "set
  sample rate failed: protocol error"), the bogus host-side `SET_SAMPLE_TYPE`
  command is gone, and the bias-tee uses a GPIO write. `Open` resets the
  receiver and retries on transient device-gone errors, and the device pool now
  normalises `AIRSPY SN:` / `airspy_sn:` serial aliases when matching config
  hints. Includes opt-in real-hardware tests (`make test-airspy-real`) and a
  Windows WinUSB interface-recipient/associated-interface control-transfer
  fallback.
- **HackRF now claims its USB interface on macOS** (#511). The pure-Go USB
  backend enumerated a HackRF but failed to claim interface 0, returning
  `kIOReturnUnsupported` — `ClaimInterface` passed the device user-client type
  ID, but an interface service requires `kIOUSBInterfaceUserClientTypeID`. The
  interface path now uses the interface UUID (the device-open path keeps the
  device UUID).
- **Live audio plays in Chrome via Web Audio** (#598). The "Tap to enable
  audio" button did nothing in Chrome on macOS: the hidden `<audio>` element
  couldn't reliably play the daemon's open-ended chunked "infinite WAV", and
  the failure was swallowed. The web player now reads the stream with `fetch()`
  and a Web Audio pipeline (a `PcmFramer` reassembles the WAV header and int16
  samples across chunk boundaries, scheduling gapless buffers through a jitter
  buffer with underrun resync), surfaces failures as a visible "Audio failed —
  tap to retry" chip, reads the sample rate from the WAV header, and sends the
  bearer token so auth-gated daemons work. No backend change.
- **Symbol-domain scopes default to the control SDR** (#402). The Eye Diagram,
  Symbol Scope, Tuning, and Histogram panels each defaulted to the first
  enumerated device, which on a multi-SDR rig is often an idle voice/aux
  dongle, so a panel opened during active control-channel decode showed
  nothing. A new `defaultSymbolDevice()` prefers the control-role device
  (falling back to the first entry) for the initial selection in all four
  panels. Also adds an MMR City clean-decode regression fixture
  (`TestReplayMMRCityDecodesCleanP25`) that guards the C4FM path against
  future regressions.

## [v0.3.7] — 2026-06-09

This release sharpens **P25 Phase 1 voice** and consolidates the **install
layout**. The decoder now error-corrects the outer Reed-Solomon layer on the
LDU1 Link Control and LDU2 Encryption Sync (#589), so a real-air capture's
talkgroup gating stops fragmenting calls into ~1 s files; on top of that the
IMBE vocoder gets TIA-102.BABA §6.3 voiced-phase regeneration to kill the
"robotic" buzz (#600), idle-carrier dead keys are muted (#599), and the LDU1
Link Control octet layout is corrected (#596). The Windows installer now
prompts for **one data folder** that holds config, recordings, IQ, exports,
the database, logs, and all three browser consoles, with config path fields
resolved relative to the config directory so a single portable config works on
any OS (#602). The **Plots** scopes gain a selectable C4FM constellation (IQ
ring vs. soft levels), an auto-detected demod mode, and a channel-step nudge
(#557, #583); the **signal survey** becomes a saved, offline-decodable artifact
(#590, #592); RadioReference picks up a built-in app key and a "verify
subscription" check (#603); browser audio now seeks on Safari (#598); and the
same talkgroup is no longer shown as two duplicate "Active calls" (#593).

### Changed

- **Single data root for installed builds** (#602). The Windows installer now
  asks for one data folder (default `Documents\GopherTrunk`) instead of two,
  and lays out `config/ recordings/ iq/ exports/ data/ logs/ web/` beneath it;
  the executable still installs to Program Files. `config.example.yaml` ships
  config-relative paths (`../recordings`, `../data`, …) and `config.Load` now
  anchors every relative path field to the directory holding `config.yaml`
  (absolute and empty paths are unchanged), so one portable config lands under
  the operator's chosen root on any OS. `gophertrunk run -web` resolves the
  bundled consoles under `<DataRoot>/web` via `GOPHERTRUNK_HOME` /
  `GOPHERTRUNK_CONFIG`.

### Added

- **RadioReference built-in app key + subscription verify** (#603). A developer
  app key can be injected at build time (`-ldflags`, kept out of source) and is
  resolved explicit > env > built-in, so browse/import works without each user
  supplying a key; the subscriber's username/password (which gate premium) are
  sent per request from the edited config in both the web and TUI Config
  Builders. A new **Verify subscription** action (web button / TUI `[V]`,
  `POST /api/v1/config/rr/verify`) reports premium status and expiry inline.
- **Constellation: selectable C4FM display (IQ ring vs. soft levels)** (#557).
  C4FM is constant-envelope FM with no complex symbol constellation, so the
  Symbols view previously plotted its soft decisions as a thin horizontal line
  on the real axis. A new **Display** control (shown for C4FM) chooses between
  the **IQ ring** — the raw constant-envelope circle most operators expect,
  now the default — and the legacy **Soft levels** line. CQPSK is unchanged.

### Fixed

- **P25 Phase 1 calls no longer fragment from un-error-corrected control
  words** (#589). LDU1 Link Control (talkgroup/source) and LDU2 Encryption Sync
  (ALGID/KID) were decoded with only the inner Hamming(10,6,3) layer; the outer
  Reed-Solomon codes were never corrected, so residual bit errors corrupted the
  talkgroup the recorder's gating relies on — dropping ~71% of voice frames,
  splitting calls into ~1 s files, and producing garbage ALGIDs. The framing
  layer now does bounded-distance RS decoding over GF(2⁶) (Berlekamp-Massey +
  Chien + Forney) for RS(24,12,13), RS(24,16,9) and RS(36,20,17), run as the
  outer layer in `ParseLinkControl` / `ParseEncryptionSync`; when a word is
  RS-uncorrectable the composer leaves `tg=0` so the boundary tracker inherits
  the last match instead of ending the call on a mis-decode.
- **P25 voice no longer sounds robotic / "wrongly pitched."** The pure-Go IMBE
  synthesizer generated every voiced harmonic with a fully phase-coherent
  model (each harmonic locked to an exact multiple of the fundamental, frame
  after frame). Perfectly coherent harmonics re-align once per pitch period and
  radiate a buzzy impulse train — the classic "robotic" vocoder artifact that
  made decoded voice sound markedly worse than the reference imbe_vocoder (e.g.
  OP25), affecting both the C4FM and CQPSK demod paths since they share the
  vocoder. The decoder now applies TIA-102.BABA §6.3 voiced-phase regeneration:
  the voiced upper harmonics (l > L/4) accumulate a per-frame random phase step
  (drawn from a separate seeded source so the unvoiced-noise stream — and any
  output that depends on it — is byte-identical, and the decode stays
  deterministic), matching the reference's
  `if (i > num_harms_max/4) ph_mem[i] += rand()`. Low harmonics stay coherent
  so pitch and formant structure are preserved.
  Measured on the reported real capture, the mean voiced-frame crest factor
  dropped from ~3.2-3.4 to ~2.4 — the impulse-train peakiness behind the buzz.
  AMBE+2 (Phase 2) is unchanged.

- **P25 Phase 1 voice no longer plays a buzzy tone at the start/end of
  recordings (and on dead keys).** An unmodulated/idle voice-channel carrier —
  the brief moment before a talker actually speaks, the tail after they release,
  and whole carrier-only "kerchunk" grants — produces a near-constant C4FM dibit
  stream that the IMBE FEC resolves to a degenerate low-`b_0` frame (fundamental
  ~350 Hz, the highest-pitch / fewest-harmonic corner of the codebook). The
  vocoder was synthesizing that as an audible ~350 Hz buzz, so recordings opened
  with a tone "before the voice started" and dead-key grants were pure buzz.
  Field captures confirmed real speech never sustains that `b_0` corner across
  frames, so the IMBE decoder now mutes a *run* of these idle-tone frames to
  silence (reusing the existing silence-frame fade), while leaving an isolated
  low-`b_0` voiced frame untouched. The fix is in the decoder, so both recorded
  WAVs and live audio benefit. Regression tests decode real captured `.raw`
  sidecars (an all-tone dead key, and a call whose voice is bracketed by tone
  runs) to pin the behavior.
- **P25 Phase 1 voice recordings no longer fragment into tiny per-LDU files.**
  A single continuous transmission was being chopped into many ~1-second
  recordings (each `.raw` an exact multiple of one LDU), because the embedded
  LDU1 Link Control was reading the talkgroup from the wrong content octets.
  For the Group Voice Channel User LCO (0x00) the talkgroup lives at octets 4-5
  and the source at 6-8 (TIA-102.AABF); the decoder was reading the talkgroup
  from octets 2-3, so it always came back as the constant service-options byte
  (0x0400 = 1024) while the real talkgroup landed inside the misread source
  field. With the in-band talkgroup never matching the granted talkgroup, the
  voice composer's foreign-talkgroup gate ended every call after ~2 LDU1s and
  the control channel immediately re-granted, spawning a fresh file each time.
  The Link Control octet layout is corrected (the FEC was always fine) and a
  regression test now pins the absolute octet positions. As defense-in-depth,
  the foreign-talkgroup gate now requires the *same* foreign talkgroup across
  its debounce window so a lone RS-aliased mis-decode can't end a call.

### Added

- **Signal survey — save it, decode it, run it offline.** Follow-up to the live
  signal survey: the classified inventory is now a real artifact, written to
  `survey.json`/`survey.csv` by the CLI, served by `GET /api/v1/hunt/survey`
  (`?format=json|csv`, `+ /{id}/survey`), and downloadable from the web Hunt
  panel. Pages a survey decodes are published to the events bus and the pager
  log like a live receiver's, and each classified carrier emits a
  `hunt.candidate` event. New depth: an **offline survey** (`hunt -survey -in
  <capture>`) classifies recorded IQ with no SDR; **`-survey-audio <dir>`**
  writes a WAV clip per active analog-FM carrier; **`-classify-only`** skips
  decoding for a fast inventory; **`-max-dwell-seconds`** listens until carrier
  activity for bursty paging. The classifier's thresholds are now configurable
  (CLI `-class-*` flags / REST fields), occupied bandwidth is measured on the
  full-rate capture so wideband FM isn't mis-sized, and the digital-vs-AM order
  was fixed so pulse-shaped PSK isn't mislabeled AM. The web panel gains a
  classify-only toggle and a sortable signals table.

- **Live signal survey — `gophertrunk hunt -survey`.** The hunt sweep now does
  more than chase trunking control channels: in survey mode it classifies
  *every* detected carrier by modulation family (analog NBFM/WFM, AM, digital
  FSK/C4FM/PSK, paging, trunking) plus an occupied-bandwidth estimate, then
  decodes the conventional ones — POCSAG/FLEX paging and analog-FM activity
  (carrier + CTCSS/DCS) — while still folding any trunking control channel into
  the discovered-system map. The classifier is blind and cheap (FFT
  occupied-bandwidth, envelope coefficient-of-variation, FM-discriminator
  features, and a cyclostationary baud-line detector), reusing the existing dsp
  primitives and the POCSAG/FLEX/conventional decoders rather than duplicating
  them. The result is a `SignalSurvey` inventory surfaced across the CLI
  (printed table), the daemon REST API (`hunt.survey` request flag, `mode` +
  `signals` in `GET /api/v1/hunt`), the web Hunt panel (a Survey-mode checkbox
  and a signals table), and the TUI Hunt panel (a `v` survey-start key and a
  signal list).
- **Constellation / Symbol scope auto-detect the demod mode** (#557). The
  panels' **Mode** selector gains an **Auto** option (now the default) that
  follows the modulation the selected SDR's system is configured to decode —
  C4FM or CQPSK/LSM — instead of asking the operator to pick it. The daemon
  reports this per device on `GET /api/v1/spectrum/devices` as `p25_modulation`,
  resolved by matching the device's tuning against the configured P25 Phase 1
  systems (with a single-system fallback). An explicit C4FM/CQPSK choice still
  overrides Auto and persists.
- **Channel-step nudge in the shared tuning controls** (#557). The
  Constellation and Symbol scope offset field gains a **Step** selector
  (6.25 / 12.5 / 25 kHz) with −/+ buttons and ArrowUp/ArrowDown stepping that
  snap to the channel grid, so walking between adjacent channels no longer
  needs manual kHz entry. The chosen step is shared across panels.

### Fixed

- **Constellation / signal scopes stuck on "waiting for symbols"** (#557,
  #583). The `WS /api/v1/diag/symbols` frame encoded its `dibits` field as a
  Go `[]uint8`, which `encoding/json` serialises as a base64 string rather than
  a JSON number array. The web console drops any frame whose `dibits` isn't an
  array, so every frame was silently discarded and the Constellation, Symbol
  scope, Eye, Tuning, and Histogram panels never rendered. `dibits` now goes
  out as a number array, with a regression test asserting the wire shape.
- **Same talkgroup no longer shows as two duplicate "Active calls"** (#593).
  The duplicate-grant guard keyed an in-progress call on frequency, but a call's
  frequency can change mid-call (a P25 band-plan IdentifierUpdate re-maps the
  channel, or the system hands the call to a new channel), so the guard missed
  and a second `ActiveCall` was bound for the same talkgroup. A logical call is
  now identified by (System, GroupID, Timeslot); on a same-call grant with a
  changed frequency the engine retunes the bound device in place (preserving
  `StartedAt`, no spurious CallStart), or releases it and binds a capable one —
  still exactly one call.
- **Browser audio now plays/seeks on Safari (macOS/iOS)** (#598). Safari's media
  element refuses to play unless the server honors Range requests, but
  `/api/v1/audio/stream` only ever returned a plain open-ended 200 WAV body, so
  "Tap to enable audio" silently failed on macOS while Chrome/Firefox tolerated
  it. The endpoint now answers Safari's bounded probe and open-ended
  `bytes=N-` request with `206` + `Accept-Ranges` + `Content-Range`; requests
  with no Range header keep the existing 200 path. The web player also logs
  `play()` failures instead of swallowing them.
- **Config Builder no longer opens a blank tab** (#595). Two independent defects
  blanked `/config/`: release/installer CI only built the main console before
  `go build`, so the binary embedded an empty `web/configbuilder/dist` and the
  route was never mounted; and the main console's PWA service worker intercepted
  `/config/` navigations via `navigateFallback`. CI now builds the Config
  Builder (and siglab) in every release/installer job, and `/config/` is added
  to the service worker's `navigateFallbackDenylist`.

## [v0.3.6] — 2026-06-08

This release is about **seeing the signal**. A new **Plots hub** (`/plots`)
gathers the per-channel scopes — Constellation, Symbol scope, Eye diagram,
Tuning, Histogram — into one tabbed home that mirrors OP25's Plots tabs (#557,
#583), now with a true symbol constellation, an open four-level eye, live
receiver-state meters, and a symbol-distribution histogram. Underneath, **P25
Phase 1 voice finally decodes** after the IMBE channel-convention and LDU
voice-frame-offset fixes (#574, #578); **TETRA** gains real ETSI training
sequences, a corrected control-channel sync layer with auto-learned colour
code, and soft-decision SB-burst FEC (#569, #571, #573); and a shared
**voice-recording boundary** controller tightly bounds every call by hangtime
and talkgroup (#579). On the operator side, the web **Config Builder** reaches
dual-editor parity with the TUI (#570–#582), the **spectrum** panel gains a
hover readout and dual-pager DDC (#577), and a two-page **Getting Started**
guide lands for non-technical users (#581).

### Added

- **Universal voice recording boundaries — hangtime + per-transmission
  splitting + talkgroup gating** (applies to every voice protocol: FM, DMR,
  P25 Phase 1/2). A new shared boundary controller in the composer ends a call
  promptly once voice stops (configurable `trunking.voice_hangtime_ms`, default
  3.5 s) instead of waiting out the 30 s engine watchdog, so recordings are
  tightly bounded to the actual transmission. `trunking.voice_call_grouping`
  selects `"transmission"` (default — one WAV per over, rolled at each
  end-of-transmission boundary) or `"conversation"` (consecutive same-talkgroup
  overs in one file). On shared voice frequencies, audio from a *different*
  talkgroup is no longer appended to the wrong recording: the P25 Phase 1 chain
  gates each LDU on its decoded Link Control talkgroup and ends the call when
  another talkgroup takes the channel. Recording filenames now carry the RF
  voice-channel frequency (`<stamp>_freq<Hz>_src<src>…`).
- **Plots hub** (`/plots`) — one tabbed home for the per-channel signal
  scopes (Constellation, Symbol scope, Eye diagram, Tuning, Histogram),
  mirroring OP25's Plots tabs (#557 follow-up). The chosen sub-tab is
  reflected in the URL (`/plots/<tab>`); the individual routes still work
  for deep links, and the wideband Spectrum waterfall stays its own tab.
  This replaces the five separate scope entries in the nav with one.
- **Symbol histogram panel** (`/histogram`) — the recovered-symbol
  distribution plus a derived signal-quality readout (#557 follow-up). A
  scrambled P25 channel spreads evenly, so each of the four bins should
  sit near 25%; a **Balance** meter flags a skewed (collapsed-eye)
  distribution, and for C4FM an **SNR (MER)** estimate is derived from the
  soft-level separation vs within-level spread. Computed client-side off
  the existing symbol stream.
- **Tuning panel** (`/tuning`) — live receiver-state meters, GopherTrunk's
  take on OP25's Mixer / Tuner (FLL) tabs (#557 follow-up). Trends the
  demod's residual carrier-frequency-offset estimate (should converge to
  0 Hz on lock) and surfaces AGC level/target, symbol-clock μ/sps and (on
  CQPSK) the equalizer's CMA-error convergence proxy — all read live from
  the production receiver and carried on the existing symbol stream.
- **Eye diagram panel** (`/eye`) — GopherTrunk's take on OP25's datascope
  (#557 follow-up). The daemon's C4FM receiver gains an oversampled,
  AGC-scaled eye tap; the panel folds it over the symbol period and
  overlays the windows so the four-level eye is visible. A healthy channel
  shows four open bands with clear gaps at the decision instant; a closed
  eye flags symbol-timing or SNR trouble. C4FM only (CQPSK's quality view
  is the constellation).
- **True symbol constellation** on the Constellation panel (#557 follow-up).
  The panel gains a **View** toggle: **Symbols** (new default) plots the
  receiver's actual symbol-decision points — for **P25 CQPSK/LSM** a real
  complex constellation that forms four tight clusters on the ±45°/±135°
  diagonals on a clean signal and smears to an X as the eye closes; for
  **P25 C4FM** the four recovered soft levels on the real axis (its open
  4-level eye remains the Symbol scope's job). Amber rings mark the ideal
  cluster centres. The previous wideband-IQ scatter is still available as
  **Vector scope (raw IQ)** for identifying unknown signals. The symbols
  stream reuses the live receiver (`WS /api/v1/diag/symbols`), so it shows
  exactly what the production demod sees.
- **Web Config Builder — dual-editor parity with the TUI** (#570, #572, #576,
  #580, #582). The browser-based Config Builder gains the editor primitives it
  was missing (ListEditor, AdvancedJSON, Fieldset, HzField), a shared
  HTTP-free config core with whole-file marshal/write and per-section
  validation, and backend gap-fill (multi-error reporting, comment-preserving
  merge, file management, RadioReference name lookup). A dual-editor
  schema-drift test now fails CI if any config field is editable in one editor
  but not the other, so the web and TUI builders stay in lockstep.
- **Two-page Getting Started guide** (#581) — a non-technical walkthrough
  (`/getting-started-setup.html`) that takes a new user from download to a
  running scan, featuring the Config Builder, plus refreshed interfaces and
  source-section help sourced from the shared field registry.
- **Spectrum hover readout + dual-pager DDC** (#577). The wideband Spectrum
  waterfall now shows a live frequency/power readout under the cursor, the
  paging DDC can run two channels at once, and decoded pages carry a
  human-readable pager-type label.

### Fixed

- **TETRA control channel would not lock on real signals** (#569, #571, #573).
  The SB-burst lock chain used placeholder sync constants instead of the real
  ETSI training sequences, the control-channel sync layer mis-framed bursts,
  and the FEC was hard-decision only. The decoder now uses the ETSI normal/
  synchronisation training sequences, a corrected sync layer that auto-learns
  the colour code, and soft-decision FEC for the SB-burst, so a production
  144 kHz / 8 sps TETRA control channel locks.

- **P25 Phase 1 voice still garbled after the IMBE channel-decode fix —
  wrong LDU voice-frame positions** (#489 follow-up). With the channel
  decoder corrected, real-air voice was still noise: the LDU1/LDU2 field
  layout in `ldu.go` placed a Link Control block between voice frames u_0 and
  u_1 (`u0, LC1, u1, LC2, …`), but real P25 (per szechyjs/dsd `p25p1_ldu1.c`,
  which reads IMBE frames 1 and 2 back-to-back) is `u0, u1, LC1, u2, LC2, …,
  u7, LSD, u8`. This shifted voice subframes u_1..u_7 by one 40-bit block, so
  only u_0 and u_8 landed on the right bits and the other seven decoded to
  random pitch. `lduVoiceOffsets`, `lduLCESBlockOffsets`, and
  `lduLSDBlockOffsets` are corrected to the real layout (also repairing
  voice-channel Link Control / Encryption Sync / talker-alias metadata, which
  read the same tables). The pre-existing layout test had the DSD order
  inverted and is fixed; a new independent fixture
  (`ldu_realair_test.go`), built from the mbelib/DSD reference with voice
  frames at hard-coded canonical positions, now guards the layout end-to-end.
- **P25 Phase 1 voice decoded to garbled noise** (#489). The IMBE 4400
  channel decoder was self-consistent (its own encode/decode round-tripped)
  but did not match the on-air convention real P25 transmitters use, so every
  recovered voice frame was effectively random — audible as warbling noise.
  Three coupled faults, all invisible to the synthetic round-trip tests and
  surfacing only on real signals: (1) each Golay/Hamming vector's channel bits
  were read in reversed column order; (2) the §7.4 PRBS descrambler took its
  seed from the wrong end of u_0 and applied the keystream in reversed order;
  and (3) the per-vector FEC used `internal/radio/framing`'s Golay(24,12),
  which is a *different* code from the P25 IMBE Golay(23,12,7) and corrupted
  clean codewords. The IMBE path now uses a P25-faithful Golay(23,12,7) +
  Hamming(15,11,3) (transcribed from the mbelib/DSD reference) with the
  correct column order, descrambler seed (taken from the Golay-corrected u_0,
  matching mbelib's `eccC0`-before-`demodulate` order), and keystream
  direction. A real-air-faithful reference-vector test
  (`internal/voice/imbe/p25fec_refvec_test.go`) now pins the decode against
  mbelib/DSD-derived on-air frames, closing the long-standing "no real P25
  voice fixture" gap.

### Changed

- **Constellation & Symbol scope tuning refinements** (#557 follow-up). The
  Symbol scope now shows the tuned frequency as soon as an SDR is selected,
  instead of staying blank until symbols decode. Both panels gain precise
  channel entry: the **kHz** offset field takes 1 Hz resolution (so 6.25 /
  12.5 kHz channel grids land exactly) plus an absolute **MHz** frequency
  field that stays in sync. The Constellation plot is now a responsive square
  that fills the panel column (up to 880 px, drawn at device-pixel ratio for
  crispness) instead of a fixed thumbnail, so it renders as large as OP25's,
  and gains an adjustable **Zoom** control (up to 8×; dots scale with both
  zoom and plot size); its auto-scale now targets the ~95th-percentile radius
  so a stray outlier no longer shrinks the cloud.
- **Warn when message decoders are configured without storage** (#568). A
  decoder that produces messages (paging, MDC, DSC, …) but has no storage
  backend configured silently dropped everything; the daemon now logs a
  startup warning so the misconfiguration is visible.

## [v0.3.5] — 2026-06-07

Site/system **hunting** grows up — `gophertrunk hunt` turns from a one-shot
capture mapper into a live, daemon-integrated discovery engine driven from the
CLI, the TUI, and a web panel with a REST cockpit (#549–#558) — alongside a
live **Symbol scope** oscilloscope (#563) and a much-improved
**Constellation** panel with a server-side frequency-offset view (#559). On
the SDR side, `soapyremote` finally streams reliably (flow-control ACKs,
#545), wideband sources can run up to 20 MHz (#560), and a per-device
`iq_invert` lets spectrum-inverted front-ends lock TETRA (#562).

### Added

- **Site/system hunting — live, daemon-integrated discovery of undocumented
  trunked systems** (#549–#558). `gophertrunk hunt` now does far more than map
  a pre-recorded capture: a live spectrum-sweep discovery engine scans for
  control channels off a live SDR, with a CLI live mode driving it (#552); a
  daemon-integrated hunt manager acquires a spare SDR — else borrows one from
  the pool — to run the sweep inside the running daemon (#554); and the run is
  surfaced through TUI + web-console panels (#556) backed by a REST cockpit
  (#555). Each run honours a requested SDR serial (#558), exports by run id
  with a bounded run history (#558), and can be started straight from the TUI
  panel (#558). Discovery auto-identifies the protocol, accumulates a
  `DiscoveredSystem` map, and resolves per-protocol **site topology** —
  system id + adjacent sites — for P25 (#551), DMR Tier III, EDACS, Motorola
  Type II, NXDN, and TETRA single-site identity (#558), exporting standardized
  files plus a ready-to-paste RadioReference submission. See
  [`docs/hunt.md`](docs/hunt.md).
- **Symbol scope — live demodulated-symbol oscilloscope (OP25-style "Symbol"
  plot)** (#563). A new web panel (`/symbols`) renders the demodulated symbol
  stream off a live SDR: for **P25 C4FM** it shows the pre-slicer soft
  waveform (~4 noisy bands for a healthy channel, with rails at each decided
  level), and for **P25 CQPSK** the sliced dibit decisions. It reuses the
  **production** DSP — the same down-converter and P25 Phase 1 receiver the
  live decoder uses, run as a *parallel* decode on the iqtap broker so
  production control-channel decode is never touched — exposed through the
  receiver's existing soft/dibit taps. The panel shares the Constellation
  panel's offset / Hold / follow-active-call controls, so you can dial the
  scope onto a locked control/voice channel and lift it clear of the SDR
  centre DC spike. Backed by a new
  `WS /api/v1/diag/symbols?device=&proto=&offset=` endpoint and the
  `internal/scanner/symbolscope` engine. The offline **SigLab** analyzer gains
  the matching view: a capture run with `collect IQ diag` + `capture IQ` now
  carries an aligned symbol series on its `IQTaps`, rendered by a new SigLab
  Symbol-scope viz alongside the eye diagram. TETRA and the rest of the C4FM
  family (DMR/NXDN/YSF/D-STAR) — and a soft waveform for them — follow as
  per-receiver soft taps ship. See [`docs/symbol-scope.md`](docs/symbol-scope.md).
- **Constellation panel — frequency-offset view + cleaner render (issue
  #557)** (#559). A centre-tuned constellation is dominated by the SDR's DC
  spike (the DDC's residual carrier leakage at 0 Hz), which sits on top of any
  signal in the middle of the band and reduces the plot to one fat blob. The
  panel now offers an **Offset** control that mixes an off-centre control or
  voice channel down to baseband *server-side, before decimation* (a new
  `offset` parameter on `WS /api/v1/diag/iq`), pulling its symbols out from
  under the spike — the same approach OP25 takes. With **Hold** off the
  offset automatically follows the newest active call on the selected SDR
  (the "last locked channel"); Hold pins it. Decimation now box-averages
  each stride window as a crude anti-alias low-pass, and the render gains an
  additive scatter in GopherTrunk's sky-blue accent (distinct from OP25's
  phosphor green) with labelled ±1 axes, a **DC-block**
  (subtract the rolling mean), and an **Auto-scale** that fills the unit
  circle.
- **`soapyremote`: free-form device-args config block (issue #542)** (#546). A
  `sdr.soapy_remote.device_args` map passes arbitrary key/value pairs straight
  to SoapyRemote's device factory, so a remote front-end that needs
  driver-specific arguments (antenna path, reference clock, channel) can be
  configured without a code change.
- **`ccdecoder`: per-device spectrum-inversion (`iq_invert`) option** (#562).
  A new per-device `iq_invert` flips I/Q at the source so a spectrum-inverted
  front-end (R828D / RTL-SDR Blog V4) locks TETRA and the other control
  channels; shipped with a production-rate (144 kHz / 8 sps) TETRA
  control-channel lock test (#561, #553).

### Changed

- **`sdr.sample_rate` config ceiling raised to 20 MHz** (#560) for wideband
  sources (HackRF, Airspy, or a SoapyRemote-fronted USRP / LimeSDR) that can
  feed a wider span than the previous cap allowed.

### Fixed

- **`soapyremote`: send stream flow-control ACKs so RX actually streams (issue
  #542)** (#545). SoapyRemote's data stream is flow-controlled; without the
  periodic ACKs the server throttled itself to a stop after the initial burst,
  so the tuner appeared to connect but delivered no samples.
- **Drive the IQ pump for single-channel decoders on dedicated dongles (issue
  #547)** (#548). A single-channel decoder bound to its own dongle was not
  pumping IQ through the channelizer, so a dedicated-dongle conventional /
  single-system setup never produced samples; the pump now runs on that path.

## [v0.3.4] — 2026-06-06

High-bit-depth **SoapyRemote** network SDRs and a first-class raw-IQ
**capture** toolchain land (#540, #541), plus a fast algebraic BCH(63,16) NID
decoder that clears the P25 decode-lag (#492) and a batch of RTL-SDR R82xx /
R828D gain and PLL fixes.

### Added

- **SoapySDRServer remote SDRs — high-bit-depth network streaming + control
  from professional hardware (issue #536)** (#541). A new pure-Go (zero-CGO)
  `soapyremote` SDR backend connects to a remote `SoapySDRServer` (from
  pothosware/SoapyRemote) and mounts it as a virtual tuner alongside local
  USB dongles and `rtl_tcp` endpoints. Unlike `rtl_tcp`'s hardcoded 8-bit
  stream, it carries the full dynamic range of high-end radios — USRP,
  LimeSDR, bladeRF, HackRF, Airspy, RTL-SDR, SDRplay — as 16-bit (`CS16`) or
  32-bit float (`CF32`) IQ, with native frequency / sample-rate / gain
  control over SoapyRemote's RPC protocol. Configure under `sdr.soapy_remote`
  (addr/driver/serial/role/format/gain/…); the IQ stream uses the in-order
  TCP transport. Chosen over the originally-proposed VITA 49.2 (VRT) because
  SoapyRemote reaches the same professional hardware with a real,
  interoperable control plane and a single maintained server binary.
- **`gophertrunk capture` — record raw IQ off a live SDR to a `.cfile`**
  (#540). A first-class subcommand that opens a dongle directly (no daemon),
  records the requested number of seconds of raw IQ to a GNU Radio cfile
  (interleaved little-endian float32) or rtl_sdr-native `u8`, and writes a
  siglab `.metadata.json` sidecar so the capture is a drop-in fixture for
  `replay` / `analyze` / `test` and the `samples/` acceptance harness:
  `gophertrunk capture -freq 460000000 -sample-rate 2400000 -seconds 30
  -protocol p25 -out cc.cfile` (`gophertrunk capture -list` enumerates
  SDRs). Complements the daemon's existing `--iq-capture` diagnostic,
  which taps a control SDR already in the running pool.
- **Capture-and-export from the SigLab web console** (#540). A new "Capture
  from tuner" control on the Captures panel records a fixed-length raw-IQ
  capture off a live tuner through the daemon, stages it for immediate
  analysis, and offers the raw `.cfile` as a browser download. Backed by
  new HTTP routes `GET /api/v1/siglab/capture/devices`,
  `POST /api/v1/siglab/capture`, and
  `GET /api/v1/siglab/captures/{id}/download`. The routes return 503 when
  the console is offline (`siglab serve`) or the daemon has no SDR, so a
  build without a tuner doesn't pretend it can record.
- **DMR Tier II Voice LC Header FEC verified against MMDVM + off-air
  diagnostics** (#539). The Tier II Voice LC Header decode path is now
  cross-checked against MMDVM's reference FEC and gains off-air diagnostics so
  a failing real-capture header reports where in the BPTC / RS chain it broke.

### Fixed

- **framing: fast algebraic BCH(63,16) NID decoder clears the P25 decode lag
  (issue #492)** (#534, #537). The NID decode is replaced with an algebraic
  Berlekamp–Massey / Chien BCH(63,16) decoder, removing the per-frame latency
  that was starving the P25 control-channel decoder.
- **rtlsdr: fix inverted mixer-AGC bit and missing VGA in R82xx
  `SetGainMode`** (#535). The R82xx gain-mode path inverted the mixer-AGC
  control bit and never set the VGA, leaving manual-gain dongles deaf; both
  are corrected.
- **rtlsdr: use a VCO power reference of 1 for R828D (Blog V4) PLL fine-tune**
  (#538). The R828D / RTL-SDR Blog V4 PLL fine-tune used the wrong VCO power
  reference, hurting fine-tune accuracy on that tuner.
- **`soapyremote`: stream setup now follows SoapyRemote's real TCP handshake,
  fixing a crash against live `SoapySDRServer` hardware (issue #542)** (#543).
  The TCP stream setup was a single-reply, single-socket guess; real
  SoapyRemote is a two-phase, two-socket exchange (the server replies with the
  data port, accepts both a stream **and** a status socket, then replies with
  the integer stream id). The old code misread the first reply (`setup stream
  port: short rpc response`), which kicked the daemon into a reconnect storm
  that could segfault the remote UHD/USRP server. Setup now opens both sockets,
  reads the stream id as an int, and allows a longer deadline for cold high-end
  devices that spend seconds compiling their RFNoC graph. Verified against the
  upstream source; smoke-test against live hardware before relying on it.
- **`soapyremote`: a manual `gain` now applies on front-ends without AGC
  (issue #542)** (#543). Setting a numeric gain first disabled automatic gain
  control; on radios with no AGC at all (e.g. a USRP TwinRX) that call fails
  with `set_rx_agc() is not supported on this radio` and used to abort the
  whole gain set, leaving the device at its default. Disabling AGC is now
  best-effort, so the manual gain value is still applied.

## [v0.3.3] — 2026-06-05

The P25 CQPSK **linear path** now decodes C4FM — a T/2 fractionally-spaced
equalizer (#532, #492) plus a multipath-gated carrier seed (#529) — and
**SigLab** grows a standalone web SPA over an offline HTTP API (#530). Plus
RTL-SDR Blog V4 detection diagnostics (#528) and a DMR Tier II BPTC/RS
bit-layout fix (#527).

### Added

- **SigLab: standalone web SPA + offline HTTP API** (#530). `siglab serve`
  exposes the offline signal-analysis engine over HTTP and ships a standalone
  Signal Lab single-page app with multi-capture visualization, backed by a new
  in-memory decode path and decimated-IQ taps so a capture can be analysed
  without writing intermediate files.
- **RTL-SDR Blog V4 detection diagnostics + manual override (issue #264)**
  (#528). The tuner-detection path now reports why it did (or didn't) classify
  a dongle as a Blog V4, with a manual override for the ambiguous R828D case.
- **Docs: decoder live-capture requirements summary** (#526). A new summary of
  what each decoder needs from a live capture (sample rate, span, SNR) to lock.
  See [`docs/decoder-capture-needs.md`](docs/decoder-capture-needs.md).

### Fixed

- **DMR: BPTC/RS bit layout corrected so real Tier II Voice LC Headers decode**
  (#527). The BPTC(196,96) + RS(12,9,4) bit ordering didn't match on-air Tier
  II Voice LC Headers, so real captures failed FEC; the layout now matches
  MMDVM and decodes live headers.
- **p25/cqpsk: T/2 fractionally-spaced equalizer so the linear path decodes
  C4FM (issue #492)** (#532). A symbol-spaced equalizer can't correct the
  timing error a C4FM signal carries on the linear (CQPSK) path; the new T/2
  fractionally-spaced equalizer does, so the linear demodulator recovers C4FM.
- **p25/cqpsk: gate the carrier seed on multipath; un-skip the #492 repro**
  (#529). The coarse carrier seed only helps under multipath, so it is now
  gated on a multipath estimate (it was biasing clean-signal locks), and the
  #492 reproduction test is un-skipped.

## [v0.3.2] — 2026-06-04

DMR grows up — multi-slot, Tier III band-plan voice, and license-free
direct mode — and a new offline signal toolkit (`siglab`) lands. The DMR
Tier III control channel now resolves voice grants through a configurable
LCN→frequency band plan (#510) and follows both TDMA timeslots of a
carrier as concurrent, separately-recorded calls (#512, #513), backed by
a stride-aware 2-slot voice decoder (#514), embedded Link Control
timeslot→talkgroup labelling (#515), opt-in composer wiring (#516), and
per-slot metrics / active-call views (#517). DMR Tier I (PMR446 simplex
direct mode) decodes too (#523), and `replay` now runs DMR Tier III / II
captures offline with a `-conjugate` flag for spectrum-inverted
front-ends (#518). The headline addition is **siglab** (#519–#523): a
protocol-agnostic offline replay / test / analysis toolkit that drives
all 14 protocols through the production decode pipelines —
`gen` / `test` / `analyze` / `replay` / `identify` subcommands, a
standalone TUI, structured exporters, synthesis fixtures for every
protocol, per-protocol FEC-outcome tallies, and an auto-detecting signal
identifier. On the P25 side, #524 pins the CQPSK equaliser's centre-tap
phase so the constant-modulus taps stop random-walking into a false
carrier offset.

### Added

- **Offline DMR decode in `gophertrunk replay`.** The `replay` subcommand
  now decodes DMR Tier III / Tier II captures, not just P25 Phase 1: pass
  `-protocol dmr-tier3` (or `dmr-tier2`) to run a raw IQ file through the
  same production `dmr/receiver` + `tier3`/`tier2` control-channel chain
  the daemon uses, printing the locked color code / system ID. A new
  `-conjugate` flag negates Q **before** channelization to decode a
  spectrum-inverted / I-Q-swapped front-end (the RTL-SDR Blog V4 / R828D
  "are I and Q reversed?" case, issue #264) — applied at the source so an
  off-DC channel is no longer pulled from the mirror offset, which the
  post-channelization dual-polarity burst decode cannot recover on its
  own. Combined with `-tune-hz` / `-auto-tune` this makes a captured
  `.cfile` a reproducible DMR test fixture and the primary tool for
  confirming whether a dongle is actually receiving the intended signal.
- **Per-timeslot observability for DMR calls.** A DMR carrier's two
  concurrent calls are now distinguishable in the live views and
  metrics: the TUI active-call Flags column shows `TS1` / `TS2`
  (alongside `E` / `!`), the web active-call detail surfaces a
  Timeslot field, and a new
  `gophertrunk_dmr_voice_calls_total{system,timeslot}` Prometheus
  counter splits DMR voice starts by slot so an operator can spot a
  slot that never carries traffic (a routing/decode gap). Non-slotted
  protocols are unaffected (no slot shown, counter not touched).
- **DMR 2-slot interleaved voice wired into the composer (opt-in).** The
  interleaved decoder + embedded-LC labelling from the previous changes
  are now reachable end-to-end on the production voice path behind a new
  per-system `dmr_interleaved_voice: true`. When set, the DMR Tier III
  control channel tags its voice grants (`Grant.DMRInterleavedVoice`),
  and the composer runs `voice.NewInterleavedDecoder` and routes each
  call to its timeslot with a `slotRouter` — it keeps only the
  superframes whose embedded Link Control names the grant's talkgroup,
  binding that slot's phase so subsequent LC-less superframes still
  route correctly. Defaults off (untouched configs keep the single-slot
  decoder). Verified end-to-end against synthetic modulated 2-slot IQ
  (one talkgroup per slot → only the granted talkgroup's audio reaches
  the recorder). A skip-gated `-tags integration` harness
  (`GOPHERTRUNK_DMR_2SLOT_CFILE`) is the place to validate the on-air
  constants against a real capture before promoting it to the default —
  see [docs/status.md](docs/status.md) and `config.example.yaml`.
- **DMR embedded Link Control decode → per-timeslot talkgroup labelling.**
  On a BS-sourced carrier both timeslots use the identical burst-A voice
  sync, so the sync alone cannot say which slot (and which talkgroup) a
  superframe belongs to. The voice decoder now reassembles the embedded
  Link Control carried by the sync field of bursts B–E — EMB split →
  the new variable `framing` BPTC(128,72) (Hamming(16,11,4) rows + a
  5-bit CRC) → the existing `dmr.FLC` parser — and, on a clean CRC,
  surfaces the call's talkgroup + source on `VoiceSuperframe.LC`.
  Combined with the interleaved decoder's `Phase`, that lets a consumer
  bind each timeslot to a concrete talkgroup. New FEC primitives
  (`framing.HammingEncode/Decode16_11`, `framing.Encode/DecodeEmbeddedLC`,
  `dmr.SplitEmbeddedField` / `dmr.ReassembleEmbeddedLC`) are round-trip
  + single-error-correction tested. The exact ETSI embedded-signalling
  de-interleave order, EMB QR(16,7) FEC, and 5-bit CRC polynomial are
  internally consistent but still pending a real-capture cross-check, so
  the path stays opt-in at the library level — see
  [docs/status.md](docs/status.md).
- **DMR 2-slot interleaved voice decoder.** The DMR voice superframe
  decoder previously assumed a single-slot stream — bursts A–F at a
  contiguous 132-dibit cadence — which only holds for synthetic
  single-slot vectors. A real DMR carrier is 2-slot TDMA: the two
  timeslots' bursts interleave, so a call's own bursts are 264 dibits
  apart. New `voice.NewInterleavedDecoder` (stride 2) handles that — it
  locks each slot's burst A on its own voice sync, gathers that slot's
  B–F by striding over the interleaved other-slot burst, and emits one
  superframe per slot, told apart by the new `VoiceSuperframe.Phase`
  field. `NewDecoder` (stride 1) is unchanged for single-slot streams.
  The exact same-slot cadence on live BS-sourced air (CACH/guard
  handling) still needs a real IQ capture before the interleaved path
  replaces the single-slot decoder on the production composer, so it
  stays opt-in at the library level for now — see
  [docs/status.md](docs/status.md).
- **DMR timeslot is now a first-class call attribute (TS1/TS2).** A DMR
  Tier III carrier interleaves two independent calls — one per TDMA
  timeslot — but the slot was parsed from the grant CSBK and then
  thrown away, so the two calls could not be told apart downstream. The
  grant now carries a 1-based `Timeslot` (0 = not applicable, 1 = TS1,
  2 = TS2), mapped from the CSBK's slot bit on both the standard and
  vendor (Capacity Plus / Connect Plus) grant paths, and surfaced
  through the JSON/SSE API, the gRPC `Grant` message, and the web DTO.
  This is the foundation for separating concurrent same-carrier calls;
  engine/recorder routing and per-slot voice decode land in follow-ups.
- **DMR timeslot routing: TS1 + TS2 are now followed as concurrent
  calls.** Building on the grant attribute above, the trunking engine
  treats `(frequency, timeslot)` as the call identity: a TS2 grant on a
  carrier already running a TS1 call is no longer folded into it by the
  duplicate-grant guard (which previously matched on talkgroup +
  frequency only), so both slots bind their own voice tap / `role: voice`
  SDR and run simultaneously. Each slot is recorded as a distinct WAV
  (`…_ts1.wav` / `…_ts2.wav`, so same-talkgroup slots no longer collide
  on disk), persisted to the call log's new `timeslot` column (added by
  an idempotent migration on existing databases), and surfaced through
  the REST/SSE/gRPC call-history APIs and the web DTO. Following both
  slots of one carrier at once requires at least two voice taps/devices
  that cover the frequency — see
  [docs/hardware.md](docs/hardware.md).

- **DMR Tier III band plan → T3 voice on the wideband dongle.** A
  Tier III voice-grant CSBK references its traffic channel by a 7-bit
  Logical Channel Number (LCN), not an absolute frequency, so the
  decoder needs an LCN→frequency map to follow a call. That resolver
  was never wired from config — both the wideband (`widebandt2`) and
  dedicated-dongle (`ccdecoder`) decode paths built the Tier III
  `ControlChannel` with a nil resolver, so every T3 voice grant was
  dropped with `decode.error stage=no-bandplan` before it reached the
  voice pool. New per-system `dmr_band_plan` config (`linear`
  base/spacing/offset grid **or** an explicit `table` of `{lcn,
  freq_hz}`) is converted to a `tier3.Resolver` and threaded into both
  paths via `tier3.ResolverFromPlan`. Resolved grants are served by the
  existing virtual voice pool (`voice_taps` DDC taps on the wideband
  dongle) or a physical `role: voice` SDR. A `protocol: dmr` system with
  no band plan warns at start-up and keeps decoding the control channel.
  See [`docs/hardware.md`](docs/hardware.md) and `config.example.yaml`.

- **`siglab` — an offline signal replay / test / analysis toolkit**
  (#519–#523). A new protocol-agnostic engine (`internal/siglab`) drives
  any of the 14 protocols GopherTrunk decodes through the same production
  `ccdecoder` pipelines the daemon uses, collecting a structured `Result`
  with exporters and a metadata-driven acceptance harness. It is surfaced
  through five `gophertrunk` subcommands and a standalone (daemon-free)
  Bubbletea TUI:
  - `replay` now routes every protocol — not just the three native
    deep-diagnostic paths (`p25p1`, `dmr-tier3`, `dmr-tier2`) — through
    the shared engine, so `replay -protocol <any>` covers all protocols
    while preserving the P25/DMR receiver-state + soft-eye
    instrumentation.
  - `analyze` decodes a capture and exports a structured signal-quality
    report (`text` / `json` / `jsonl` / `yaml` / `csv` / `csv-events`).
  - `gen` synthesises a test capture + metadata sidecar for a protocol
    with impairment knobs (SNR, carrier offset, DC, I/Q imbalance);
    `test` decodes a capture and grades it against the sidecar's
    acceptance criteria, exiting 0/1 for CI gating. Synthesis fixtures
    now cover every protocol (P25 Phase 1/2, DMR Tier I/II/III, NXDN,
    dPMR, YSF, TETRA, EDACS, Motorola Type II, LTR, MPT 1327, D-STAR).
  - `identify` auto-detects the protocol in a capture — it scans a
    bounded prefix of each registered protocol and scores lock + frame
    sync-cadence + FEC evidence, then runs and renders the full analysis
    of the winner (low-confidence results are flagged inconclusive rather
    than asserted).
  - Per-protocol **deep analysis**: a symbol histogram, a sync-correlation
    landscape against each protocol's own sync word(s), and FEC-outcome
    tallies (clean / corrected / uncorrectable, or CRC pass/fail) — DMR
    slot-type Hamming, EDACS BCH(40,28,2), Motorola BCH(64,16,11),
    D-STAR header CRC-16, NXDN LICH + CAC Viterbi, P25 Phase 2 ISCH
    Golay + MAC trellis, and TETRA SCH/HD RCPC Viterbi.

  The hard-won P25/DMR replay diagnostics that previously lived as
  text-only code in `cmd/` are now consolidated in the engine, so they
  are structured and exportable (`analyze -out-format json|yaml|csv`),
  not just stderr text. See [`samples/README.md`](samples/README.md) for
  the toolkit walkthrough and the unified metadata schema.
- **DMR Tier I (license-free direct mode).** GopherTrunk now decodes DMR
  Tier I — the PMR446 / simplex direct-mode tier. Tier I is wire-identical
  to conventional Tier II (132-dibit burst, BPTC(196,96) + RS(12,9,4)
  Voice LC Header, slot-type Hamming); only the direct-mode sync words and
  the protocol tag differ, so the Tier II conventional channel is
  parameterised by sync word + protocol tag rather than duplicated. The
  new `dmr-tier1` protocol restricts to the four ETSI direct-mode syncs
  (DM-Voice/Data TS1/TS2) so it won't false-lock on base-station traffic,
  and is wired through trunking config, the `ccdecoder` factory, wideband
  validation, and the voice recorder/composer (#523).

### Fixed

- **P25 CQPSK equaliser centre-tap phase pinned** (#524, #492) — the
  constant-modulus equaliser's cost is invariant to a global rotation of
  its tap vector, so the taps random-walked in phase along that null. The
  drift looked like a frequency offset to the downstream Costas loop,
  which integrated it. The centre tap is now anchored to the positive real
  axis after each update, removing the ambiguity without changing `|y|` and
  stabilising the equaliser output phase. A new skip-gated
  `TestCQPSKDemodRecoversFSWWithMultipathAndOffset` reproduces the
  near-spectral-null simulcast case that biases the raw-IQ lag-1 coarse
  seed into a spurious offset; it becomes the regression guard once the
  robust seed fix is validated against a real capture.

## [v0.3.1] — 2026-06-03

RTL-SDR Blog V4 reception finally works and the issue #402 live-decode
push lands its structural fix. #506 cures V4 deafness (the V4 runs a
28.8 MHz crystal and a switched HF/VHF/UHF input bank the stock driver
never handled), #501 opens the WinUSB child interface of composite
(usbccgp) dongles on Windows, and #499 decodes spectrum-inverted DMR
bursts on the R828D. On the #402 front, #507 decouples live IQ ingest
from decode (a forwarder goroutine + a deeper bounded decode queue) and
#508 pools the queued buffers to fix the aliasing that introduced, while
#496 surfaces ADC clipping and #505 stops the driver shedding live IQ.
#497/#503 add CQPSK carrier recovery so a real tuner offset no longer
kills control-channel lock, #498 corrects the P25 Phase 1 LDU
voice-frame interleaving, and #502 adds a diagnostic banner plus verbose
error reporting across every surface. #504 bumps the Go toolchain to
1.25.11 to clear two stdlib advisories.

### Added

- **Diagnostic banner + verbose error reporting across all surfaces**
  (#502) — a new `internal/diag` package prepends a banner (build
  version, OS / kernel, host specs, detected dongles) to every error
  surface and offers a full verbose trace (unwrapped `%w` chain + a
  goroutine stack dump). CLI / launcher error exits route through a
  shared reporter (banner + concise error, then the trace on a verbose
  build or on demand on a TTY); the daemon emits a one-time banner to the
  log at start-up. New top-level `diagnostics.verbose_errors`
  (overridable by `-verbose-errors` / `GOPHERTRUNK_VERBOSE_ERRORS`); the
  HTTP API attaches the banner to the JSON error envelope when enabled
  and exposes `GET /api/v1/diag/banner`; gRPC interceptors decorate
  failing RPCs (config flag or `gophertrunk-verbose` metadata); the web
  `ErrorBoundary` surfaces the diag block in a collapsible panel.
- **ADC-clipping detection** (#496, #402) — a hot, strong-signal site can
  pin the 8-bit RTL ADC rail and shred TSBK CRC while the RMS
  `iq_power_dbfs` gauge averages the peak clipping away. The `ccdecoder`
  now counts rail-pinned IQ samples in the existing power window (no
  extra pass) and exposes an `iq_clip_ratio` gauge plus a throttled WARN
  advising to *reduce* gain / add attenuation; the startup low-gain hint
  is caveated so it no longer points operators the wrong way on an
  overloaded front end.
- **`cchunt.failed` now explains *why*** (#500) — the control-channel
  hunter only ever reported the symptom (retuned everywhere, no lock).
  It now carries the control SDR's live IQ health (dBFS power, DC-bin
  ratio, clip ratio — the #402 signals) with a one-line diagnosis on the
  `cchunt.failed` event payload and a new WARN line; when the decoder saw
  no IQ at all, that absence becomes the diagnosis (check `sdr list
  --probe` / `sdr doctor` / antenna).

### Changed

- **Go toolchain bumped 1.25.10 → 1.25.11** (#504) — clears two stdlib
  advisories `govulncheck` flags (`GO-2026-5037` crypto/x509,
  `GO-2026-5039` net/textproto); both are toolchain-version issues fixed
  only by building against the patched standard library. `go.mod` and the
  `setup-go` version across CI / release / installer workflows updated.
- **Live IQ ingest is decoupled from decode** (#507, #402) — the
  control-channel decoder previously decoded inline on the same goroutine
  that drained the SDR's delivery channel, so any stall (pipeline
  rebuild, GC pause, host contention) made the driver silently drop
  real-time IQ and splice the C4FM stream — the live-fails / replay-green
  signature. A lightweight forwarder now drains the SDR channel into a
  larger bounded decode queue, so a transient stall backs up instead of
  dropping RF. New `ccdecoder_decode_overruns_total` (distinct from
  `sdr_iq_underruns_total`) makes a CPU/host overload provable.
- **Queued IQ buffers are pooled; power/clip/DC observed on the
  forwarder** (#508, #402) — the deep decode queue from #507 could hold
  more driver buffers than the #489 reuse ring allows in flight, so a
  recycled ring slot could corrupt IQ already queued for decode. The
  forwarder now copies each chunk into a pooled, decoder-owned buffer
  before queueing and releases the driver slot immediately, restoring the
  ring invariant; IQ power / clip / DC observation moves onto the
  forwarder so the gauges reflect every chunk the SDR delivered,
  including those dropped at the queue under overload.

### Fixed

- **RTL-SDR Blog V4 deafness** (#506, #264) — the V4 received only noise
  (a raw capture was pure complex white noise across the band), so the
  earlier "color code changes constantly" was the decoder false-locking
  on noise. Two V4-specific gaps versus the rtlsdr-blog librtlsdr fork:
  the V4 runs a **28.8 MHz** reference crystal (PR #266 had keyed every
  R828D to 16 MHz by chip type, mis-tuning every V4 LO by ~1.8×), and the
  V4's switched HF/VHF/UHF input bank was never routed (stock R828D init
  leaves both Cable-1 and Air-In off, so no RF reaches the tuner). The
  fix detects the V4 from its USB strings and, gated entirely on that,
  restores the crystal and ports the fork's per-band input switching,
  notch windows, GPIO5 upconverter relay, and HF tracking-filter bypass —
  R820T2 / non-V4 R828D paths are byte-for-byte unchanged.
- **WinUSB composite (usbccgp) dongles on Windows** (#501) — a composite
  RTL-SDR (e.g. the V4) presents its parent bound to `usbccgp` and the
  real SDR driver on the Interface 0 (`&MI_00`) child node that Zadig
  binds to WinUSB. GopherTrunk only walked the parent-registered device
  interface, so `Open` initialised the wrong node and `sdr doctor` read
  the parent's `usbccgp` service and reported a false BAD. New
  Windows-only discovery walks the USB device-node tree, matches VID/PID +
  `&MI_00`, and opens / inspects the WinUSB child; the parsing logic is
  factored into platform-independent helpers with table tests.
- **DMR spectrum-inverted (I/Q-reversed) bursts on R828D / V4** (#264) —
  a conjugated IQ stream negates the FM discriminator, flipping the
  slicer by `(dibit + 2) mod 4`; P25 Phase 1 already tolerated this but
  DMR did not, and DMR's sync words are closed under the flip so sync
  alone can't resolve polarity. The Tier II / III adapters now decode
  each matched burst at both polarities and let the slot-type Hamming +
  BPTC + CSBK CRC drop the wrong one — identity is tried first, so clean
  R820T2 streams take exactly the same path as before.
- **CQPSK carrier recovery** (#497, #492) — the CQPSK / LSM path had no
  carrier-frequency recovery, so a residual tuner offset spun the whole
  differential constellation and the Frame Sync Word never correlated
  (the synthetic fixtures injected zero offset, hiding it). A two-stage
  recovery now runs: a one-shot lag-1 (Kay) coarse estimate on the raw IQ
  feeding an NCO, then a decision-free second-order `QPSKCostas` loop that
  tracks slow drift. Replay's `carrier_hz_est` diag now shows the loop
  converging to the tuner offset.
- **CQPSK carrier seed under streaming chunk sizes** (#503, #492) — the
  #497 coarse seed only fired when a single `process()` call carried
  ≥ 2048 samples, but production hands the decoder only ~160–200 complex
  samples per call, so the seed never tripped and the full offset reached
  Gardner. The lag-1 autocorrelation is now accumulated across calls
  until the threshold is met, then seeded once (resetting Costas + CMA,
  which had wound up against the uncorrected signal).
- **P25 Phase 1 LDU voice-frame interleaving offsets** (#498, #489) —
  even after the §7.5 IMBE deinterleaver landed, voice decode stayed
  ~100% uncorrectable because the LDU voice-frame slice offsets were
  wrong: the on-air LDU interleaves an LC/ES block between every voice
  subframe with both LSD blocks between u_6 and u_7, so only u_0 sliced
  correctly. The offset tables are corrected to the real interleaving
  (also fixing LC/ES and LSD extraction), pinned by a new field-sequence
  test.
- **Control-channel SDR shedding live IQ** (#505, #489) — a control SDR
  was dropping 25–48% of live IQ chunks/sec (`consumer can't keep up`),
  corrupting the dibit stream into uncorrectable LDUs / TSBK CRC
  failures: the pure-Go deliver path allocated a fresh ~64 KiB buffer per
  chunk and the consumer channel was only 8 deep. A per-stream reuse ring
  (allocation-free hot path), a `u8→complex64` lookup table (bit-identical
  output), and a deeper (8 → 32) stream channel give the resample loop
  jitter headroom; drop-on-overrun stays real.

## [v0.3.0] — 2026-06-02

The issue #402 live-decode investigation drives this release. #486 fixes
a broker close-race panic and surfaces previously-silent live IQ drops
(the live-fails / replay-green tell), #491 hardens the live
control-channel acquisition path and pins the reverted AFC /
adaptive-slicer experiments so they can't silently return, and #493
fixes live CQPSK control-channel lock (an over-gained Gardner timing loop
that only locked on sample-aligned fixtures). #490 corrects P25 Phase 1
voice decode with the IMBE §7.5 deinterleave, #487 applies PPM correction
to the tuner LO rather than only the resampler (#264), #480 extends log
retention to every decoder table and adds a currently-visible aircraft
endpoint, and #488 surfaces silent recorder / composer misconfigs.

### Added

- **Retention sweep across all decoder log tables** (#480) — the sweeper
  only ever deleted `call_log` rows (+ recording files), so `pager_log`,
  `aprs_log`, `vessel_log`, `dsc_log`, `aircraft_log`, `mdc1200_log`,
  `m17_log`, and `location_log` grew unbounded. A new `LogRowMaxAge` knob
  (driven by `retention.log_days`; zero = disabled) deletes rows older
  than the cutoff from each table via a fixed allow-list of table names
  (no user input in the SQL). `config.example.yaml` + `docs/hardening.md`
  updated.
- **Currently-visible aircraft endpoint** (#480) — `aircraft_log` stores
  one Mode-S message type per row, so the raw log can't answer "what's
  flying right now". `GET /api/v1/adsb/aircraft/current` (`?max_age_s=`,
  default 300, max 3600) coalesces the latest non-empty value of each
  field group (callsign / position / altitude / velocity) per ICAO over a
  horizon, newest-last-seen first.
- **Live IQ-drop telemetry** (#486, #402) — IQ chunks dropped on overrun
  by an SDR backend (the consumer falling behind) were silent, making
  live IQ loss indistinguishable from RF problems. Drops now bump the
  existing `iq_underruns_total` Prometheus counter (labelled by driver +
  serial) and emit a warning throttled to one line per second per device,
  via a process-wide `sdr.SetIQDropObserver` hook the daemon installs at
  start-up. A rising counter during decode confirms a live-path overrun
  (offline replay never drops) and explains downstream TSBK CRC failures.

### Changed

- **iqtap broker primary handoff is now lightly buffered** (#486, #402) —
  the broker's primary IQ channel gained a small (2-chunk) buffer so the
  fan-out goroutine isn't stalled by a momentarily-busy primary consumer
  (the per-chunk copy plus a brief decode hiccup), which previously could
  back up the SDR reaper and force whole-chunk drops. The inner driver's
  buffer still bounds latency, so sustained back-pressure still drops as
  before.
- **RTL-SDR PPM correction now re-tunes the tuner LO** (#487, #264) —
  `Device.SetPPM` only wrote the RTL2832U resampler-ratio registers, so a
  configured `ppm` corrected the sample clock but left the tuner carrier
  offset in the signal (a V4's `ppm: -4` had no visible effect and broke
  digital decode). The R82xx tuner now biases its reference crystal by
  `xtal·(1 + ppm·1e-6)` (librtlsdr's `APPLY_PPM_CORR`) and re-tunes;
  `ppm == 0` reproduces the existing register math byte-for-byte, and only
  R82xx-family tuners participate.
- **Live control-channel acquisition path hardened** (#491, #402) — the
  remaining #402 failure was live-only (replay decoded the reporter's
  captures cleanly), isolating it to the acquisition chain replay never
  exercises. A same-`(system, frequency)` `HuntProgress` retune is now
  idempotent (a single-candidate system re-hunting every dwell never
  converged before); the down-converter is built from the SDR's
  *actual* delivered sample rate so a non-exact-divisor rate doesn't
  drift the symbol clock; a too-low-gain warning covers the 51–149 tenths
  band the dB-mistake check missed; and the reverted DDA / adaptive-C4FM
  experiments are pinned off so they can't return.
- **Surface silent recorder / composer misconfigs** (#488) — three
  defensive diagnostics for issues that previously produced only
  INFO-level output: a WARN at P25 Phase 2 chain start when trellis
  decoding is off (live MAC PDUs are trellis-encoded), a Windows WARN when
  `recordings.dir` / `storage.path` / `storage.cc_cache_file` are rooted
  but carry no drive letter (the Unix-style defaults normalise to a
  surprising drive root), and collapse of an exact trailing duplicate word
  in imported system names.

### Fixed

- **iqtap broker `send on closed channel` panic** (#486, #402) — closing
  an IQ subscriber (live spectrum, `--iq-capture`, diagnostics)
  concurrently with an in-flight fan-out could crash the daemon: `fanout`
  checked the closed flag and then sent after dropping `subsMu`, while
  `Subscriber.Close` closed the channel under the lock, leaving a window
  where the send raced the close. Per-subscriber send and close now share
  a `sendMu` so a fan-out send can never land on a closed channel.
  Covered by a new `-race` regression test in `internal/sdr/iqtap`.
- **P25 Phase 1 voice: apply IMBE §7.5 deinterleave** (#490, #489) — voice
  decode reported ~100% uncorrectable LDUs on real signals because
  `DecodeChannelToFrame` ran descramble + per-vector Golay/Hamming FEC on
  the raw on-air bits without first undoing the TIA-102.BABA §7.5 144-bit
  interleaver, so every codeword exceeded its correction radius. The
  symmetric non-interleaved encode/fixture path kept round-trip tests
  green while live air failed. The deinterleave now runs before
  descramble + FEC, with a bijection guard and on-air fixture tests.
- **Live CQPSK control-channel lock: over-gained Gardner loop** (#493,
  #492) — live CQPSK control-channel decode was ~0% while the same
  capture decoded when replayed un-decimated. The Gardner loop's
  effective per-symbol gain is `gain/sps`, and the CQPSK path inherited
  the generic 0.03 default — ~5× too hot at the 48 kHz channel rate — so
  it overshot the timing null and only locked when the input was already
  symbol-aligned (the one phase every synthetic fixture starts on). The
  default drops to 0.005, matching the sibling π/4-DQPSK Phase 2 / TETRA
  pipelines; a starting-phase sweep guards it.
- **replay: decimate CQPSK like production** (#493, #492) — `replay` gated
  its production-matching decimation on `demod == c4fm`, so a wideband
  capture replayed with `-demod cqpsk` ran the whole receiver at the raw
  SDR rate (~417 samples/symbol instead of ~10), invalidating the
  replay-vs-live comparison. The DDC target is now chosen by sample rate
  alone, so both demod modes decimate when the input exceeds the
  production target.

## [v0.2.9] — 2026-06-01

Phase 3 paging completes and M17 joins the digital lineup, while the
Windows RTL-SDR control path finally works on real hardware. #478 lands a
FLEX paging decoder (1600 bps / 2-level) that decodes off the air
alongside POCSAG, both sharing the `pager_log` table and `/pager` panel;
#479 decodes M17 link-setup metadata (who's calling whom, in what mode)
off the LICH without touching audio. #476 flips the P25 Phase 2 MAC-PDU
scrambler default to on so live systems actually decode (issue #451), and
#458 documents that RTL2838U dongles are already supported. The headline
is a four-PR chain (#481–#484) that makes RTL-SDR control transfers work
under WinUSB: #483 is the root cause — the `WINUSB_SETUP_PACKET` was
passed by pointer instead of by value, so every vendor control transfer
sent garbage — backed by #481 (warmup write non-fatal), #482 (clear-halt
+ retry + a USB diagnostics dump), and #484 (NESDR v5 R82xx burst
recovery now fires on Windows pipe stalls too).

### Added

- **FLEX paging decoder (1600/2 mode)** (#478) — completes Phase 3: FLEX
  now decodes off the air alongside POCSAG, both sharing the `pager_log`
  table and `/pager` web panel, tagged by protocol. New
  `internal/radio/pager/flex` carries the logical layer (sync marker +
  mode code → frame-info word → block de-interleave → BCH(31,21) → BIW /
  address / vector / message-word walk) and a streaming decoder for the
  1600 bps / 2-level mode (alphanumeric / numeric / tone vectors). The
  FLEX BCH(31,21)+parity primitive (`internal/radio/framing/bch_flex.go`)
  reuses the tested POCSAG codeword via bit-reversal (info-low layout),
  with round-trip + 2-bit-correction coverage. The receiver mirrors the
  POCSAG DSP frontend (FM demod → resample → slicer → decoder) and
  publishes `KindPagerMessage` with `Protocol="flex"`; `pager_log` gains
  a `protocol` column (default `pocsag`).
- **M17 link-layer metadata decoder** (#479) — Milestone 4 of the
  roadmap: recover M17 link-setup metadata (caller, callee, mode) without
  decoding audio (Codec2 voice is a later milestone). New
  `internal/radio/m17` parses the LSF (base-40 callsigns, TYPE mode/CAN,
  CRC-16 poly 0x5935), reassembles the LICH (Golay(24,12), six chunks →
  240-bit LSF), and runs a streaming decoder that hunts the 0xFF5D stream
  sync → LICH → LSF, so an in-progress transmission is picked up within
  ~240 ms with no convolutional machinery. The receiver adds a C4FM DSP
  frontend (FM demod → resample → matched filter → Mueller-Müller timing
  → 4FSK slice → dibit) and publishes `events.KindM17LinkSetup`; new
  `m17_log` table, `GET /api/v1/m17/linksetups`, and an `m17.channels`
  config block. Spec constants are validated against a synthetic encoder;
  real-capture calibration and the Codec2 payload are documented
  follow-ups. See [docs/m17.md](docs/m17.md).

### Changed

- **RTL2838U dongles documented as supported** (#458) — the RTL2838U is
  the Realtek demodulator / USB-bridge chip (a variant of the RTL2832U),
  not a tuner; dongles labelled "RTL2838U" enumerate as `0x0bda:0x2838`
  and are already fully supported (the real R820T2 / R828D tuner inside
  is handled by the tuners package). The device-whitelist friendly name
  and `docs/hardware.md` now say so, so users searching for "RTL2838U"
  find confirmation their hardware works out of the box.

### Fixed

- **P25 Phase 2: default the MAC-PDU scrambler to on** (#476, issue
  #451). A live Phase 2 system logged `composer: p25p2 macCfg suggests
  live MAC PDU decode will fail` with a valid identity-derived seed but
  `scrambler=0`. Every on-air P25 Phase 2 MAC PDU is PN44-scrambled per
  TIA-102.BBAC-1 §7.2.5, so with descrambling off, MAC decode (source ID,
  talker alias, encryption sync) can never succeed. `ParseScramblerMode("")`
  now defaults to `ScramblerOn` (was `ScramblerOff`, which only suited the
  synthesized unscrambled test fixtures), mirroring `ParseTrellisMode`.
  `ScramblerOn` (not `Probe`) is correct because both production MAC paths
  already feed the spec per-slot PN44 offset from superframe sync, so no RS
  verification is needed to pick the offset.
- **Windows RTL-SDR: pass `WINUSB_SETUP_PACKET` by value** (#483) — the
  actual reason RTL-SDR control transfers never worked on real Windows
  hardware. `WinUsb_ControlTransfer` takes the setup packet *by value* and
  the x64/arm64 calling convention passes the 8-byte struct in a single
  integer register; GopherTrunk passed a *pointer*, so WinUSB read the
  pointer's low bytes as `bmRequestType/bRequest/wValue/wIndex/wLength` — a
  garbage vendor request the device timed out on (`ERROR_SEM_TIMEOUT`) or
  rejected (`ERROR_GEN_FAILURE`). Descriptor reads went through a different
  prototype and succeeded, which is why the dongle reported
  `winusb-bound=true` while every vendor transfer failed. The setup packet
  is now folded into the `uintptr` argument (little-endian, matching its
  in-memory image) at all three call sites, with a golden test pinning the
  packing.
- **Windows RTL-SDR: clear-halt + retry stalled control writes, append USB
  diagnostics** (#482). `winTransport.ControlOut` now clears the
  control-pipe halt (`WinUsb_ResetPipe` pipe 0) and retries the write once
  when it stalls with `ERROR_GEN_FAILURE`, since some clone RTL2832U
  firmwares need the explicit `CLEAR_FEATURE` the USB spec says a SETUP
  should auto-clear. When bring-up still fails, `openDevice` now appends a
  full USB diagnostics dump (bound driver — WinUSB / libusbK / DVB / none —
  device + config descriptors, and a control-IN read probe), so a single
  `gophertrunk sdr list --probe` captures everything needed to triage a
  dongle that rejects control transfers.
- **Windows RTL-SDR: make the USB warmup write non-fatal** (#481). The
  warmup write is librtlsdr's sacrificial "dummy write" that absorbs the
  first control-transfer NAK some clone dongles emit right after the
  interface is claimed; librtlsdr never checks its result. GopherTrunk had
  treated it as a must-succeed gate, and each retry re-opened the device
  and re-armed the same NAK, so the dongle never reached `InitBaseband` and
  `Open` failed with `ERROR_GEN_FAILURE`. `runBringup` now swallows any
  warmup error (logging it under `RTLSDR_DEBUG_USB`) and proceeds to
  `InitBaseband` step 0, whose byte-identical transfer is the one that
  actually needs to land; genuine stalls are still caught by the outer
  reset+retry envelope. Stale troubleshooting URLs in the bring-up hints
  now point at `gophertrunk.org` / `install-windows.html`.
- **Windows RTL-SDR: fire NESDR v5 R82xx burst recovery on Windows pipe
  stalls** (#484, issue #248). The R82xx tuner-init burst-write recovery
  (per-chunk retry + 16→8→4 chunk-size halving — the librtlsdr-parity fix
  for the NESDR v5 cold-boot I²C stall) keyed its retry guards solely on
  `syscall.EPIPE`. On Windows the identical I²C-bridge stall surfaces as
  `usb.ErrPipeStalled` (`ERROR_GEN_FAILURE`), so every layer of recovery
  was skipped and the first chunk failure propagated straight out. The
  guards are now a shared `isI2CBurstStall` predicate matching both
  classes, so per-chunk retry and the halving fallback fire on Windows
  exactly as on Linux.

## [v0.2.8] — 2026-05-31

The issue #402 control-channel decode-quality push lands its first real
win: #470 makes the P25 decoder read every TSBK in a data unit (not just
the first) and adds `replay` channel tuning for off-centre captures,
roughly tripling the TSBKs recovered on the MMR Site 9 capture. #455 lets
operators declutter the UI by switching off navigation tabs they don't
use, and #459 corrects a complex-LMS equalizer weight update while
evaluating an IQ-domain equalizer for the #402 multipath.

### Added

- **`replay` channel tuning for off-centre captures** (#402) — the
  `gophertrunk replay` subcommand can now frequency-shift a recorded
  wideband IQ file so an off-centre control channel lands at 0 Hz before
  the demodulator, the way the SDR tuner does on a live device. `-tune-hz`
  applies a fixed offset; `-auto-tune` estimates the dominant carrier from
  the start of the file. This lets a captured file whose channel was not at
  the recording centre (e.g. MMR Site 9, ~+37 kHz off) be replayed the same
  way it decodes live. Backed by a reusable `dsp.NCO` frequency shifter, a
  `dsp.EstimateCarrierOffsetHz` carrier estimator, and a tuning-offset mode
  on the `ccdecoder` down-converter. A channelised slice of the real Site 9
  control channel ships as a decode regression fixture.
- **UI navigation tabs are now configurable** (#455) — operators running
  GopherTrunk for a single task can declutter the nav by switching off tabs
  they don't use. Every tab shows by default; setting a key to `false` under
  `web.tabs` hides it from the nav strip in both the web SPA and the
  terminal TUI (routes stay mounted — nav-only hiding). New `WebConfig.Tabs`
  map with a `KnownUITabs` canonical set (`Validate()` rejects unknown
  keys); the read-only `/api/v1/runtime` snapshot carries the hidden list so
  both clients filter from one source of truth.

### Fixed

- **P25 control channel: decode every TSBK in a data unit, not just the
  first** (#402). A P25 trunking data unit packs up to three 98-dibit TSBK
  blocks after one FSW + NID, the last flagged LB=1; the control-channel
  decoder only ever decoded the first, silently dropping the ~2/3 of a busy
  site's signalling (grants, affiliations, status broadcasts) carried in the
  second and third blocks. It now decodes every block in the unit, stopping
  at the last-block flag, and resumes blocks that span receive batches — so
  the yield is the same whether the dibit stream arrives a frame at a time
  or in tiny USB transfers. On the MMR Site 9 capture this roughly triples
  the TSBKs recovered (14 → 41 in ~1 s, all CRC-clean). A non-contiguous
  dibit stream (a resync or capture gap) now also flushes the partial-frame
  buffer instead of trying to stitch a frame across the break.
- **Equalizer: correct complex-LMS weight-update conjugation** (#402). The
  complex LMS update computed `w_k += μ·x·conj(e)` instead of the correct
  `w_k += μ·e·conj(x)`; for the non-Hermitian FIR the two differ only in the
  sign of the imaginary cross-term (identical on a real channel, which is
  why the existing real-coefficient test missed it). A genie-trained
  equalizer using the corrected update fully recovers a two-ray echo (dibit
  SER 0.086 → 0.000 through the real receiver) and is a no-op on clean
  signal. No production code calls LMS yet, so no behaviour change ships
  beyond the equalizer package; a new complex-channel regression guards it.

## [v0.2.7] — 2026-05-30

Phase 5 finishes its DSP frontends and the analog side fills in. ADS-B
reaches end-to-end both ways — #440 consumes BEAST output from an existing
dump1090 / readsb with a per-ICAO CPR pair-tracker, and #449 adds a native
1090 MHz PPM Mode-S receiver so aircraft decode straight off the air; #448
gives DSC its FFSK frontend (the last "no DSP" hole in Phase 5); and #441
lands MDC1200 Motorola signaling. #445 adds a gain-units guardrail for the
common tenths-vs-dB mistake, #444 forces decoded calls to the
vocoder-native 8 kHz WAV rate (fixing garbled playback), and the #402
slicer work settles on the fixed C4FM slicer as the default (#450) with the
adaptive slicer behind a flag and its outer-rail tracking corrected (#447).

### Added

- **ADS-B end-to-end via BEAST upstreams + per-ICAO CPR pair-tracker.**
  Most 1090 MHz receive chains already run dump1090 / readsb / BeastSplitter
  against a dedicated RTL-SDR; GopherTrunk now consumes their BEAST binary
  output over TCP and feeds the frames into the same
  `events.KindAircraftReport` bus / `aircraft_log` SQLite /
  `/api/v1/adsb/aircraft` REST / `/adsb` web panel stack that shipped in
  #434. Operators add an `adsb.beast_upstreams` entry (typically
  `127.0.0.1:30005` — the standard dump1090 / readsb BEAST port) and
  aircraft start landing on the live map immediately. Reconnect-with-backoff
  on upstream drops; the embedded CPR tracker resets between reconnects so
  stale even/odd halves don't pair across the gap. New
  `internal/radio/adsb.Tracker` is the per-ICAO state machine that buffers
  the most-recent CPR half and calls `CPRDecodeGlobal` when both halves
  arrive within the spec's 10 s window (DO-260B §2.2.3.2.3.7); `Prune(now)`
  evicts ICAOs idle > 10 s. New `internal/radio/adsb/beast` package — frame
  parser (`ReadFrame` handles the 0x1A byte-stuffing, hunts for sync after a
  torn TCP segment) + reconnecting TCP client (`Client.Run`) that pipes each
  Mode-S frame through `adsb.Decode` → `Tracker.Update` → `bus.Publish`.
- **ADS-B native 1090 MHz PPM Mode-S receiver** (#449) — ADS-B now decodes
  straight off the air as an alternative to running a separate dump1090 /
  readsb. New `internal/radio/adsb/ppm` takes IQ → resample to 2 Msps →
  magnitude envelope → dump1090-style 8 µs preamble correlation → PPM bit
  slice → DF frame-length (56/112) → frame bytes, with a magnitude carry
  buffer so a preamble split across two IQ chunks still decodes. The decode
  → CRC gate → CPR track → `AircraftReport` mapping is factored into a
  shared `adsb.ProcessFrame` so the PPM and BEAST paths produce identical
  reports. `ADSBConfig` gains a `channels` list (default 1090 MHz) and the
  daemon pins the SDR off its iqtap broker, mirroring the AIS receivers.
- **DSC FFSK DSP frontend + bit-stream receiver** (#448) — closes the last
  "no DSP" hole in Phase 5: DSC had a parser, BCH(10,7), storage, REST, and
  panel scaffolding but no way to turn IQ into sequences. New
  `internal/radio/dsc/ffsk` takes IQ → FM demod → resample to 9600 sps →
  FFSK discriminator (1300/2100 Hz) → Mueller-Müller timing → direct-FSK
  slicer; the receiver slides a 10-bit window, BCH-syncs on the repeating
  phasing DX character (dual-polarity), samples the DX grid to recover 7-bit
  symbols, detects EOS, and publishes `KindDSCMessage`. New `DSCConfig` /
  channel config and daemon spawn loops, mirroring the AIS receivers.
- **MDC1200 Motorola signaling decode** (#438) — end-to-end pipeline for the
  analog FFSK data burst Motorola radios key at the head / tail of a
  transmission on conventional VHF / UHF voice channels. 1200-baud CCIR FFSK
  DSP frontend (FM demod → FFSK discriminator at 1200 / 1800 Hz →
  Mueller-Müller timing → NRZ slicer, reusing the existing `demod.FFSK`), a
  40-bit sync framer with inverted-polarity tolerance, 16×7 de-interleave,
  op / arg / unit-ID decode with a CRC-16-CCITT check, and an op/arg label
  table (PTT ANI, emergency, status, radio check, call alert, selective
  call, radio inhibit / enable, remote monitor). Plus
  `events.KindMDC1200Message`, SQLite `mdc1200_log`, `GET
  /api/v1/mdc1200/messages`, the `/mdc1200` web panel, and an
  `mdc1200.channels` config block. Clean-room implementation under
  Apache-2.0. See [docs/mdc1200.md](docs/mdc1200.md).

### Changed

- **Gain-units guardrail.** `sdr.devices[].gain` (and the rtl_tcp
  equivalent) is in *tenths* of a dB — `"320"` = 32 dB — but operators
  coming from SDRTrunk / OP25 / gqrx routinely paste a whole-dB value like
  `"32"`, which parses to 3.2 dB and snaps to the bottom of the tuner
  ladder, leaving the radio effectively deaf (no control-channel lock, no
  decodes) with no feedback. The daemon now WARNs at startup when a
  bare-integer gain parses to ≤ 5.0 dB (`gain looks like dB, not
  tenths-of-dB …`, suggesting the ×10 value), and the SDR pool now logs the
  applied gain in dB on every device (`sdr: gain set … gain_db=…`) so a
  units mistake is visible without enabling debug. No behaviour change for
  valid configs; decimal forms like `"32.0"` are still taken as whole dB.
  Docs (`config.example.yaml`, `docs/hardware.md`) updated.
- **P25 Phase 1: fixed C4FM slicer is the default; adaptive slicer behind a
  flag** (#402). On the MMR Site 9 capture the fixed-threshold slicer is the
  best performer; every adaptive variant that moved the +1/+3 threshold
  above the fixed nominal decoded worse, because the +3 eye is spread low by
  an RF-domain asymmetry the slicer can't fix. Mirroring the #430 DDA
  precedent, the adaptive C4FM slicer is now opt-in
  (`Options.EnableAdaptiveC4FMSlicer`, default off; `replay
  -adaptive-slicer` for A/B); production pipelines (`ccdecoder`,
  `widebandt2`) revert to the fixed slicer. The adaptive slicer's threshold
  model was also improved (inward-only cap + variance-aware boundaries) so
  it is no worse than fixed on a stretched eye.
- **Voice: force vocoder-native WAV rate + decode-quality telemetry**
  (#356). The IMBE/AMBE vocoders always emit 8 kHz PCM and the recorder
  appended those samples without resampling, but the WAV header used the
  configured `recordings.sample_rate` — so a non-default rate played decoded
  P25/DMR calls back at the wrong speed (garbled). `handleStart` now
  instantiates the vocoder before opening the WAV and forces the header to
  8 kHz for decoded calls (analog/NBFM fed via `WritePCM` still honour the
  configured rate), and `CallComplete` publishes the session's actual rate,
  matching the offline decoder.

### Fixed

- **Adaptive C4FM slicer outer-rail under-tracking** (#402). The
  soft-responsibility level update scaled the data-directed pull by the
  per-symbol responsibility but leaked toward nominal at full weight every
  sample, halving the intended 0.8 mix toward the observed centroid — so a
  stretched +3 rail under-tracked and held the +1/+3 threshold below
  optimal. Scaling the leak by responsibility too restores a true
  responsibility-weighted EMA, landing the threshold at the ~0.22 optimal
  midpoint. (Behind the now-opt-in adaptive slicer flag.)

## [v0.2.6] — 2026-05-29

Phase 5 expands across marine + aviation and the panels gain a shared
map. AIS reaches end-to-end live: #427 lands the protocol layer + bus /
storage / REST / `/ais` panel scaffolding, #428 wires the 9600 Bd GMSK
DSP frontend + receiver glue (FM demod → 76,800 sps resample → GFSK
matched filter at BT 0.4 → Mueller-Müller timing → NRZI → HDLC → CRC →
`ais.Decode`), so pinning one SDR to 161.975 / 162.025 MHz lights up
vessel positions. #433 adds the DSC marine scaffolding (ITU-R M.493-15
distress / urgency / safety / routine call decode, BCH(10,7) syndrome
check, MMSI + position codecs) and #434 the ADS-B aviation scaffolding
(ICAO Annex 10 Mode-S CRC-24, DF 17 / 18 extended-squitter
identification / position / velocity decode, globally-unambiguous CPR).
#435 ties them together with a shared Leaflet `PositionMap` across the
APRS / AIS / DSC / ADS-B panels — per-protocol marker colours, XSS-safe
tooltips, camera auto-fit. Plus #419 ports the full APRS Mic-E decoder.
Trunking robustness: #426 distinguishes a carrier-drop natural call end
from a silent-timeout reap and #431 fans raw IMBE / AMBE frames out to
`rawFrameSinks` (both issue #356); #417 makes `sdr.devices` a strict-mode
allowlist (issue #264); #418 settles the warmup→step-0 race on Windows
clone dongles (issue #395); #423 builds the wideband voice taps before
the voice pool (fix #422) and #424 makes voice-grant preemption
frequency-aware; #425 corrects the Motorola alias cipher stop
recurrence. Issue #402 (RTL-SDR DC-spike on P25 control) continues:
#429 fixes the DDA-AFC handoff regression that froze a wrong carrier
offset, #430 defaults to CoarseAFC-alone and fixes the 10x AFC
diagnostic, and #432 swaps in an adaptive 4-level C4FM slicer that
tracks an asymmetric eye.

### Added

- **Live map across APRS / AIS / DSC / ADS-B.** Position-bearing
  decoded rows now plot on a shared Leaflet map at the top of
  each protocol panel. APRS station fixes (Mic-E + uncompressed
  positions) render as blue markers; AIS Class A/B vessel
  positions as cyan; DSC distress alerts that included a
  position as red (oversized for high visibility); ADS-B
  aircraft (once per-ICAO CPR pairing lands) as purple. Marker
  tooltips render the per-protocol short label (callsign /
  MMSI / ICAO+altitude / nature-of-distress); the camera
  auto-fits to the active point set on every poll-refresh.
  New `web/src/components/PositionMap.tsx` is a single
  `<PositionMap points={...}>` component the four panels share —
  one Leaflet `L.map` per panel, points → `L.circleMarker`
  diff-update keyed by stable row IDs so a row-set update
  patches markers in place instead of tearing them down. Adds
  `leaflet@^1.9.4` + `@types/leaflet` as web deps; tiles served
  from the standard OSM tile servers (compliant with the OSM
  Tile Usage Policy for the single-user self-hosted operator
  console; larger fleets configuring their own tile cache is
  the obvious follow-up). XSS-safe tooltip rendering (HTML
  escapes on all user-derived label / detail fields).
  Tests: 5 new (`PositionMap.test.tsx` — container renders,
  per-kind marker colours, distress radius / colour, HTML
  escape on tooltips, camera auto-fit). All 115 web tests
  passing (20 test files).


- **ADS-B aviation — protocol layer + bus / storage / REST / panel
  scaffolding.** First slice of Phase 5 ADS-B: every commercial
  passenger flight, most general-aviation, and all military
  aircraft over US / EU airspace continuously broadcasts on
  1090 MHz — the same data that powers FlightRadar24 /
  FlightAware / adsb.lol / OpenSky. GopherTrunk now has the
  protocol layer to decode it on the operator's own SDR.
  New `internal/radio/adsb` package decodes ICAO Annex 10 Vol IV
  Mode-S frames: CRC-24 verification with polynomial 0xFFF409
  (verified directly on DF 11 / 17 / 18; the ICAO-overlay scheme
  for DF 0 / 4 / 5 / 20 / 21 recovers the address by XORing the
  computed CRC). Extended-squitter (DF 17 / 18) type-code
  dispatch for the operator-visible majority: identification
  (TC 1-4 with the 6-bit ICAO alphabet decoding 8-char
  callsigns), airborne position (TC 9-18 / 20-22 with CPR-encoded
  lat/lon and 12-bit Q-bit altitude at 25-ft resolution), surface
  position (TC 5-8), airborne velocity (TC 19 with ground speed
  + track for subtypes 1/2, air speed + heading for 3/4, common
  vertical-rate field). Globally-unambiguous CPR position
  decoder (DO-260B §2.2.3.2.3.7) from an even+odd pair, with NL
  table matching the dump1090 reference. Validated against the
  canonical mode-s.org reference samples (identification
  "KLM1023" / ICAO 4840D6; CPR pair decodes to lat 52.2572 N /
  lon 3.91937 E / alt 38000 ft; velocity GS 159 kn / track ≈ 183°
  / VR -832 fpm).
  New `events.KindAircraftReport` event + `storage.AircraftReport`
  payload + `aircraft_log` SQLite table (one row per decoded
  frame, indexes on `(received_at)` and `(icao, received_at)`).
  `storage.AircraftLog` subscriber drains the bus and writes one
  row per message; the daemon spawns it alongside `dscLog` /
  `vesselLog` / `aprsLog` / `pagerLog`. New REST endpoint
  `GET /api/v1/adsb/aircraft?limit=N` (default 200, max 5000)
  and web panel `/adsb` with columns Received / ICAO / Kind /
  Callsign / Lat-Lon / Alt / GS-Track / VR. CRC-failed frames
  highlight yellow.
  Tests: 13 protocol-layer (identification decode, CPR pair
  global decode against the dump1090 reference vectors, velocity
  decode, all-call DF 11, short-frame safety, CRC self-
  consistency + corruption detection, NL table boundary values,
  altitude Q=1 round-trip), 4 storage (insert position / ident /
  filter / order), 3 REST (503 / list / limit), 5 web (empty /
  position / ident / velocity / error). All passing.
- DSP frontend (1 Msps PPM + Mode-S preamble correlation +
  frame extraction) follows as the next slice. See
  [docs/adsb.md](docs/adsb.md).

- **DSC marine — protocol layer + bus / storage / REST / panel
  scaffolding.** First slice of Phase 5 DSC: GMDSS Digital
  Selective Calling messages — distress alerts, urgency / safety
  broadcasts, individual / group / all-ships routine calls — are
  the SOLAS-mandated digital signalling on marine VHF channel 70
  (156.525 MHz) and the HF DSC channels. A coast-guard MMSI
  lighting up the channel-70 stream is near-instant visibility
  into SAR activity.
  New `internal/radio/dsc` package decodes ITU-R M.493-15
  formats: Distress (self-MMSI + nature + position + UTC time),
  All-Ships safety / urgency / routine, Individual call
  (target + source MMSI), Group, Geographic-area, and
  Auto-Individual. BCH(10,7) syndrome check (CRC-3 with
  `g(x) = x³+x+1`) — the spec calls it "BCH" but min Hamming
  distance is 2, so single-bit errors are reliably **detected**
  but not corrected at this layer; DSC achieves the actual
  correction via DX / RX redundancy at the bit-stream layer
  above (each character is sent twice and the receiver compares
  the two streams).
  MMSI codec unpacks 5 symbols × 2 digits → 9-digit MMSI.
  Position codec decodes the 10-digit `Q.DD.MM.DDD.MM` format
  with quadrant-bit hemisphere flip (0 = NE, 1 = NW, 2 = SE,
  3 = SW). The all-9s "position unknown" sentinel collapses
  `HasPosition` to false.
  New `events.KindDSCMessage` event + `storage.DSCMessage`
  payload + `dsc_log` SQLite table (one row per decoded
  sequence, indexes on `(received_at)` and
  `(self_mmsi, received_at)`). `storage.DSCLog` subscriber
  drains the bus and writes one row per message; the daemon
  spawns it alongside `vesselLog` / `aprsLog` / `pagerLog`.
  New REST endpoint `GET /api/v1/dsc/messages?limit=N` (default
  200, max 5000) and web panel `/dsc` with columns Received /
  Format / Category / Self MMSI / Target-or-Nature / Body /
  Lat-Lon. Rows tint by category — distress = red, urgency =
  orange, safety = blue, routine = default.
  Tests: 15 protocol-layer (BCH round-trip + syndrome check +
  single-bit error detection, MMSI codec, position quadrant
  signs, position unknown-sentinel, end-to-end distress decode
  with position + nature + UTC time, individual-call decode,
  all-ships safety decode, short-payload safety), 4 storage
  (insert distress / individual / filter / order), 3 REST
  (503 / list / limit), 4 web (empty / distress / individual /
  error). All passing.
- DSP frontend (1200 Bd FSK at 1300 / 2100 Hz tones + 10-bit
  symbol assembly + DX/RX redundancy merge) follows as the
  next slice. See [docs/dsc.md](docs/dsc.md).
- **AIS DSP frontend + receiver glue — pipeline is now end-to-end.**
  Second slice of Phase 5 AIS: `internal/radio/ais/receiver` is the
  bit-stream orchestrator (HDLC framer → CRC-CCITT validation →
  MSB-first bit unpack → `ais.Decode` → bus event); on top of it
  `internal/radio/ais/gmsk` is the IQ-to-bits frontend (FM demod
  → real resampler to 76,800 sps → GFSK matched filter at
  BT = 0.4, span 4 symbols → Mueller-Müller symbol-timing
  recovery → zero-threshold slicer → NRZI decode → `receiver.Push`).
  New top-level `ais.channels` config schema mirroring
  `aprs.channels` (serial, frequency_hz, drop_bad_fcs,
  drop_non_position). The daemon constructs one `gmsk.Receiver`
  per entry, subscribes each to its SDR's iqtap broker via the
  standard spawn closure, and the AIS pipeline goes live the
  moment an operator pins one SDR to 161.975 (channel 87B) or
  162.025 (88B). Same `Inner()` accessor for frame-counter
  metrics that `aprs/afsk` exposes. The bit-stream layer
  validates the same HDLC FCS algorithm AX.25 uses (reflected
  polynomial 0x8408, init 0xFFFF, final XOR 0xFFFF) — AIS
  inherits the link-layer conventions verbatim per
  ITU-R M.1371-5 §4.2. End-to-end synthetic test drives a real
  AIVDM type-1 payload (gpsd canonical sample, lat 37.802 N,
  lon -122.342 W, MMSI 366053209) through `buildAISFrame` →
  `wrapHDLC` → `Receiver.Push` and asserts the bus event
  carries the correct MMSI + decoded position. 9 new bit-stream
  tests + 8 new DSP tests, all passing.

- **AIS marine — protocol layer + bus / storage / REST / panel
  scaffolding.** First slice of Phase 5 AIS: every SOLAS-covered
  vessel (passenger ships, tankers, cargo > 300 GT) broadcasts an
  AIS position every 2-10 s on marine VHF channels 87B / 88B
  (161.975 / 162.025 MHz) — free wide-area positional data
  GopherTrunk now has the protocol layer to decode. New
  `internal/radio/ais` package decodes the operator-visible
  majority of ITU-R M.1371-5 message types: Class A position
  reports (types 1/2/3, layout in §3.3.1), Class B position
  reports (type 18), Class B extended (type 19), base-station
  reports (type 4), static + voyage data (type 5: vessel name,
  IMO, call-sign, destination, ETA, ship type, dimensions), and
  Class B static data (type 24 Parts A + B). MSB-first
  bit-field readers (`readBitsUint`, `readBitsInt` with proper
  two's-complement sign-extension) decode the spec's signed
  lat/lon (28-bit longitude, 27-bit latitude, 1/600000 minute
  resolution). The 6-bit ASCII text table (M.1371-5 Table 47)
  unpacks vessel-name / call-sign / destination fields with
  trailing-padding stripped. Spec "not available" sentinels
  (lat 91°, lon 181°) collapse the `HasPosition` flag.
  New `events.KindAISMessage` event + `storage.AISMessage`
  payload + `vessel_log` SQLite table (one row per decoded
  message, indexed on `(received_at)` and
  `(mmsi, received_at)`). `storage.VesselLog` subscriber drains
  the bus and writes one row per message; the daemon spawns it
  alongside `aprsLog` / `pagerLog`. New REST endpoint
  `GET /api/v1/ais/vessels?limit=N` (default 200, max 5000) and
  web panel `/ais` with columns Received / MMSI / Type / Body /
  Lat-Lon / SOG-COG. Static-data rows show vessel name + call-
  sign + destination; position-data rows show lat/lon + SOG /
  COG. CRC-failed messages highlight yellow. Decoder validated
  against the gpsd AIVDM canonical samples (Class A position
  matches lat 37.802118 N, lon -122.341618 W; static-voyage
  decodes a non-empty vessel name + call-sign).
  Tests: 14 protocol-layer (bit-readers, sign-extension, 6-bit
  ASCII table, type dispatch, AIVDM round-trip for types 1, 18,
  5, "not available" sentinel handling, hex round-trip), 4
  storage (insert / static / filter / order), 3 REST (503 / list
  / limit), 4 web (empty / position / static / error). All
  passing.
- DSP frontend (9600 Bd GMSK + HDLC framer) follows as the next
  slice. See [docs/ais.md](docs/ais.md).

## [v0.2.5] — 2026-05-28

Issue #376 follow-up (Motorola MMR P25 talker alias) closes end-to-end +
Phase-5 (APRS) goes live + issue #402 (RTL-SDR DC-spike on P25 control)
three-phase investigation. The Motorola MMR talker-alias path now lands:
#397 ports Motorola's vendor LCO 0x15 / 0x17 form for Phase 1 voice
channels (the standard TIA-102.AABF form #389 implemented doesn't match
what real MMR systems emit), #403 dispatches MAC PDUs on the Phase 2
voice chain so MMR Phase 2 talker-alias decodes too, and #409 backfills
source RID + ALGID / KID encryption from the voice channel by parsing
`GROUP_VOICE_CHANNEL_USER_ABBREVIATED` (opcode 0x01, previously
mis-named `OpMACPTT` and silently discarded). APRS reaches end-to-end
live: #401 adds the HDLC framer + receiver glue, #411 wires the
Bell-202 AFSK DSP frontend (IQ → FM → real resample → tone
discriminator → Mueller-Müller timing → NRZI → HDLC → AX.25 + APRS
info-field → events bus), so configuring `aprs.channels` with a serial
+ frequency lights up the bus, SQLite log, REST endpoint, and `/aprs`
web panel from #384 / #390. Issue #402 (RTL-SDR DC-spike pulls the
P25 control-channel offset estimator into the spike) lands in three
slices: #406 adds CCStats + per-sample recording-power diagnostics,
#408 mirrors the replay path through the production DDC and adds
state-evolution diagnostics, and #412 swaps in a decision-directed AFC
that defeats data-DC integration. Plus: #399 makes the P25 Phase 1
voice composer honour `trunking.systems[].p25_phase1_demod_mode` so
simulcast / LSM grants don't silently fail on FM-discriminator
hardcode; #398 widens the Windows RTL-SDR cold-boot recovery envelope
to 5 attempts with 200 / 400 / 800 / 1200 ms backoff and 150 ms
WinUSB settle (issue #395); #400 surfaces two silent-degradation
paths at startup (no `gain:` configured per SDR, conventional tone
gating with zero `sdr.sample_rate`); #413 routes Phase 1 TDMA-channel
grants to the Phase 2 voice chain; #407 promotes Motorola patch
member talkgroups over the super-group in CC Activity (issue #405);
and #396 adds a Markdown blog with per-category archives, RSS, and
SEO meta to the Pages site.

### Added

- **APRS Mic-E decoder.** Mobile-tracker packets (Kenwood TH-D74,
  Yaesu FT-3D, vehicle trackers) compressed-encode position +
  speed + course + altitude + a 3-bit message code across the
  7-byte AX.25 destination address and a 9-byte info field — a
  third the size of an uncompressed beacon, which is why every
  mobile tracker emits it. `aprs.DecodeWithDst(info, dst)` walks
  the Table 10.5 destination-char encoding (six latitude digits +
  message bits + N/S + lon-offset + W/E), then the §10.4
  speed/course interleaved encoding with the standard 800/400
  wrap corrections, then the optional base-91 `XXX}` altitude
  marker. Resulting `MicE` carries Latitude / Longitude / Speed
  (knots) / Course (deg) / SymbolTable / SymbolCode / MessageCode
  (`"M3 Returning"`, `"Emergency"`, custom-code variants) /
  Standard (std vs custom range) / Altitude (m) / HasAltitude /
  Comment. Latitude + Longitude also surface through the standard
  `Position` field so the storage row, the `/api/v1/aprs/packets`
  payload, and the `/aprs` panel pick the coordinates up without
  special-casing Mic-E. The bit-stream orchestrator
  (`aprs/receiver`) calls `DecodeWithDst` with the AX.25
  destination call so the path is wired end-to-end. Spec: APRS
  Protocol Reference 1.0.1 §10. Refreshes the `/aprs` panel
  empty-state copy now that the DSP frontend has shipped.
- **APRS DSP frontend — pipeline is now end-to-end.** Fifth and
  load-bearing slice of Phase 5 (#365 plan): the
  `internal/radio/aprs/afsk` package wires an `afsk.Receiver`
  per configured APRS channel between the iqtap broker and the
  bit-stream orchestrator that shipped in #401. Pipeline: IQ →
  `demod.FM` → real resampler down to 9600 sps → `demod.FFSK`
  tone discriminator (mark 1200 Hz, space 2200 Hz) → Mueller-
  Müller symbol-timing recovery → DC-tracking slicer → NRZI
  decode → HDLC framer → AX.25 + APRS info-field parse →
  `events.KindAPRSPacket`. New top-level `aprs.channels` config
  schema (`internal/config.APRSChannelConfig`, mirroring
  `paging.pocsag`); daemon constructs one receiver per entry,
  subscribes each to its SDR's iqtap broker via the standard
  spawn closure. `Stats()` surfaces IQ-samples-seen + bits-
  emitted; the bit-stream layer's frame counters remain reachable
  via `Inner().Stats()`. Operators add an entry like
  `serial: antenna-pi, frequency_hz: 144_390_000` and packets
  start landing on the bus, the `aprs_log` SQLite table,
  `/api/v1/aprs/packets`, and the `/aprs` web panel.
  Tests cover NRZI round-trip (transition / no-transition
  polarity, clamping, reset), receiver option validation,
  Process ctx-cancel + nil-input + clean-close, and stats
  counter accumulation. The synthetic IQ end-to-end test is
  currently `t.Skip`-ped pending a captured `samples/aprs/`
  fixture (same posture as POCSAG #378 — the receiver code is
  exercised by the unit-level coverage above and the orchestrator
  tests from #401).
- **P25 Phase 2 traffic-channel metadata backfill (issue #376
  follow-up).** Resolves the symptoms surfaced by @er-imagery's
  2026-05-28 MMR field test: Phase 2 grants on encrypted
  talkgroups arrived with `src=0` + `enc=false`, ALGID/KID never
  populated, and `composer: p25p2 talker alias` log lines never
  fired — even after #403 wired alias dispatch into the voice
  chain. Root cause: the MAC opcode constant `OpMACPTT = 0x01`
  was a fictional name; the real TIA-102 / SDRTrunk opcode at
  0x01 is `GROUP_VOICE_CHANNEL_USER_ABBREVIATED`, the in-call
  broadcast that carries SOURCE_ID + SVC_OPTIONS on the traffic
  channel during an active call. Real MMR PDUs at 0x01 were
  being parsed as "MAC PTT" and discarded.
  - `phase2.OpMACPTT` is removed and replaced by
    `phase2.OpGroupVoiceChannelUserAbbreviated = 0x01`. New
    `OpGroupVoiceChannelUserExtended = 0x21` covers the SUID-
    extended variant.
  - New `phase2.GroupVoiceChannelUser` struct +
    `MACPDU.AsGroupVoiceChannelUser()` accessor parses the
    SDRTrunk-confirmed layout: SVC_OPTIONS at payload[0],
    GROUP_ADDRESS at payload[1..2], SOURCE_ADDRESS at
    payload[3..5].
  - New `events.KindCallSourceUpdate` event +
    `trunking.CallSourceUpdate` payload + `VoicePool.UpdateSource`
    method + `Engine.handleCallSourceUpdate` handler form the
    backfill path: composer publishes, engine patches
    `ActiveCall.Grant.SourceID/.Encrypted`, republishes with the
    call's identity. `AffiliationTracker` subscribes so RID
    chips populate from the backfilled source.
  - The voice composer's Phase 2 chain now also dispatches
    in-call `OpEncryptionSync` (existing parser, just hooked up)
    via the existing `KindCallEncryption` event, mirroring the
    Phase 1 LDU2 path. ALGID/KID flow onto the active call as
    the EncryptionSync PDU arrives.
  - Diagnostic safety net: one Info log line per (opcode, MFID)
    per call —
    `composer: p25p2 mac pdu system=… serial=… opcode=… mfid=…
    payload_len=…` — so if MMR emits a vendor opcode we still
    don't dispatch (e.g. a different talker-alias opcode), the
    next field test pinpoints exactly what we saw.
  - Pre-existing `phase2.OpGroupVoiceChannelUserExt = 0x46` is
    renamed to `OpUnitToUnitGrantUpdateAbbreviated` to match
    its actual TIA-102 / SDRTrunk identity. No parser was
    wired to it; the rename is name-only.
- **P25 Phase 2 voice-channel talker-alias decode.** Resolves the
  follow-up half of #376: on Motorola MMR (and any Phase 2 system
  whose CC never emits talker-alias PDUs), display names ride MAC
  sub-frames that interleave with voice sub-frames on the traffic
  channel. The voice composer's Phase 2 chain now runs the same
  MAC-PDU dispatch the CC does — refactored into the new exported
  `phase2.DecodeSuperframeMACPDUs` — and publishes
  `events.KindTalkerAlias` when a fragment sequence completes. The
  CC's per-channel FEC config (trellis / RS / interleave /
  scrambler mode + 44-bit PN44 seed) rides on the published Grant
  via a new `trunking.P25Phase2Decode` field so the composer can
  decode MAC PDUs without owning a CC reference. Field-reporter
  re-test on MMR is the real verifier; #397's Phase 1
  Motorola-form path is unchanged.
- **APRS HDLC framer + receiver.** Fourth slice of Phase 5 (#365).
  `internal/radio/aprs/hdlc` is the bit-stream → frame-bytes
  layer: sliding-flag detector with bit-stuffing reversal,
  shared-flag packing tolerance, and 7+-ones abort sequence
  handling. `internal/radio/aprs/receiver` is the orchestrator
  that threads bits through the framer, parses each emitted
  frame with `ax25.Parse`, decodes the info field with
  `aprs.Decode`, and publishes one `events.KindAPRSPacket` per
  successfully-decoded UI frame. The bus payload is a
  `storage.APRSPacket` carrying the AX.25 envelope + APRS
  sub-type label + summary + (for position-bearing types)
  lat/lon, so the SQLite log + REST endpoint + `/aprs` web
  panel from #384 light up the moment a DSP layer pushes wire
  bits at `receiver.Push`. `DropBadFCS` / `DropNonUI` opt-ins;
  in/parsed/CRC-failed/emitted counters for future `/metrics`.
  See [docs/aprs.md](docs/aprs.md).

### Fixed

- **P25 Phase 1 voice chain now honours `p25_phase1_demod_mode`
  (issue #356 follow-up, reporter @v2maldo).** The per-call P25
  Phase 1 voice receiver was hardcoded to the C4FM
  FM-discriminator path regardless of the system-level
  `trunking.systems[].p25_phase1_demod_mode` setting. On a
  simulcast / LSM site the control channel decoded fine (the
  ccdecoder connector already honoured the setting) but every
  voice grant landed in an FM-discriminator that couldn't sync on
  LSM-modulated dibits — the LDU sink never fired, the
  frame-activity counter from #356's earlier fix never advanced,
  and the watchdog reaped the call at `call_timeout_ms` with an
  empty WAV. The mode string is now plumbed through
  `trunking.Grant` and the voice composer passes it into
  `p25p1rx.Options.DemodMode`. Empty / unrecognised values warn-log
  and fall back to C4FM so a typo doesn't silently kill a
  previously-working system.
- **RTL-SDR cold-boot stall on Windows: wider recovery envelope for the
  most stubborn clone dongles (issue #395).** A Windows 10 reporter on
  v0.2.4 still hit `rtlsdr: init baseband: init baseband step 0 ...
  ERROR_GEN_FAILURE` after the prior #382 + #393 fixes — warmup succeeded
  but the byte-identical step 0 of `InitBaseband` failed, and all three
  attempts of the previous 3-attempt / 100 ms+200 ms backoff envelope
  also failed. The open-time bring-up envelope now runs 5 attempts (4
  resets) with exponential backoff (200 / 400 / 800 / 1200 ms), and the
  WinUSB `Reset()` settle grows from 50 ms to 150 ms — both targeted at
  Windows USB-stack timing for the wedged-firmware recovery path.
  Healthy dongles still open on attempt 0 with zero delay; only dongles
  that actually need recovery pay the new costs. The surfaced hint for
  `ErrPipeStalled` now also recommends unplugging the dongle for 10 s
  before re-plugging (which physically clears the firmware state) and
  references the issue for users hitting this after a Windows
  sleep/resume.

### Changed

- **Operator-visible warnings for two silent-degradation paths
  surfaced by issue #356 triage.** Both fix observability gaps
  rather than behaviour, so a working config keeps working but a
  misconfigured one now logs a single line at startup pointing
  the operator at the fix.
  - `sdr: no gain configured for device ... use \`gain: auto\` for
    AGC or a specific tenth-dB value` — fires once per device that
    has a `sdr.devices[]` entry but no `gain:` key. The librtlsdr
    default isn't safe across every tuner / antenna / LNA chain;
    on some clones it leaves the SDR deaf and the symptom looks
    like a broken voice chain. See [docs/hardware.md](docs/hardware.md).
  - `conv: tone gating configured but scanner sample rate is zero;
    tone gate disabled` — fires when a conventional-scanner channel
    has `tone.mode: ctcss` or `dcs` but `sdr.sample_rate` is
    unset. The channel previously appeared in scan rotation with
    the gate silently bypassed (every signal passing), with no log
    explaining why CTCSS / DCS wasn't engaging.
- **Motorola voice-channel talker-alias decoder (issue #376
  follow-up).** Field-testing on a real MMR system surfaced that
  the standard TIA-102.AABF HEADER + BLOCK1 + BLOCK2 form #389
  implemented does NOT match what Motorola actually emits — real
  Motorola P25 systems use a vendor-specific variant: LCO 0x15
  header (talkgroup + variable block_count + sequence number) +
  N × LCO 0x17 data blocks (44-bit fragment each), with the
  reassembled message running the encoded alias through a
  proprietary lookup-table + accumulator cipher to recover the
  UTF-16 character stream. Replaced `StandardTalkerAliasBuf`
  with a clean-room Go port of the Motorola form
  (`phase1.MotorolaTalkerAliasBuf` +
  `phase1.decodeAliasBytes`). The voice composer dispatch on
  `IsTalkerAliasLCO` is unchanged at the call site; the Info
  log line now reads "composer: p25p1 motorola talker alias
  src=... alias=..." so operators can see decode events in the
  daemon log. The cipher LUT and arithmetic are treated as
  facts about Motorola's wire protocol (the algorithm is
  reverse-engineered prior art across multiple open-source
  decoders).

## [v0.2.4] — 2026-05-27

Phase-5 (APRS) + Phase-3 (POCSAG) + Phase-1 (Radio IDs) feature-density
follow-up to v0.2.3. The APRS scaffold landed (events bus / SQLite log /
REST / web panel — #384) and immediately got its protocol layer
(pure-Go AX.25 frame parser + APRS info-field decoder — #390), with
the Bell-202 AFSK DSP receiver as the remaining follow-up. POCSAG
closed end-to-end with the DSP receiver + daemon wiring (#378), so a
tuned SDR's IQ now flows demod → bit-slicer → syncer → page event →
SQLite log / REST / web panel without further plumbing. Radio IDs
landed in three slices: the `RIDDB` alias catalogue + REST + gRPC +
`/rids` web panel mirroring `TalkgroupDB` (#387), the standard
TIA-102.AABF P25 voice-channel talker-alias LC decoder (LDU1 LCOs
0x15 / 0x16 / 0x17 — #389) closing the second half of issue #376, and
a docs pass under [docs/radio-ids.md](docs/radio-ids.md). One-dongle
deployments got more powerful: the `role: wideband` channelizer now
hosts P25 Phase 1 and Phase 2 control channels alongside DMR T2/T3
(#385), and a new "virtual voice pool" (#386) follows trunked voice
grants whose frequency lands inside the wideband IQ window — so a
single SDR can cover P25 CC + voice end-to-end. The wideband engine
also routes through the iqtap broker so the spectrum view works on
wideband-only deployments (#377). Two more Windows RTL-SDR cold-boot
stall paths now self-recover: #382 classifies the
`ERROR_GEN_FAILURE` NAK as `ErrPipeStalled` and clears the control
halt, and #393 makes WinUSB `Reset` re-open the device handle
(matching `libusb_reset_device`) and allows up to two settles during
open. Plus polish: r82xx PLL nint encoding limit widened to 268 so
V4-class dongles tune above ~140 MHz on the 16 MHz xtal (#391,
closes #264), CC Activity super-group patches finally render member
counts (#392, closes #374), and the misleading "voice pool full"
message is replaced with an actionable startup WARN pointing at
`docs/hardware.md` when no `role: voice` SDR is attached (#383,
closes #379).

### Added

- **AX.25 frame parser + APRS info-field decoder.** Third slice
  of Phase 5 (#365), the protocol layer that plugs into the
  bus/log/REST/UI scaffolding from #384. Pure-Go AX.25 frame
  parser (`internal/radio/aprs/ax25`): 7-byte address packing,
  up to 8 digipeater path entries, HDLC CRC-16-CCITT validation,
  conventional `W1AW-9` / `WIDE2-1*` display helpers. Plus an
  APRS info-field decoder (`internal/radio/aprs`) for positions
  (`!`, `=`, `/`, `@`), messages (`:`) with ack/rej + bulletins,
  status (`>`); Mic-E / weather / telemetry / object types are
  type-tagged with payloads stashed for follow-up decoders. The
  DSP receiver (Bell-202 AFSK demod → HDLC de-stuff → frame
  delivery → bus event) is the next focused PR. See
  [docs/aprs.md](docs/aprs.md).
- **Radio IDs as first-class entities (#387, #376).** New
  `trunking.RIDDB` operator-configured alias catalogue mirroring
  `TalkgroupDB`: per-system `rid_alias_file` (CSV or JSON, dispatched
  by extension) carrying `Decimal/DEC/ID` plus optional `Alias`,
  `Description`, `Tag`, `Group`, `Owner`, `Priority`, `Lockout`,
  `Watch`, `Icon` columns. `AffiliationTracker` gained `TalkerAlias`,
  `TalkerAliasAt`, `CallCount`, `FirstSeen` on `UnitActivity` and
  now subscribes to `KindTalkerAlias`. New HTTP routes `GET
  /api/v1/rids`, `GET /api/v1/rids/{id}`, `GET
  /api/v1/rids/{id}/history` (backed by `HistoryFilter.SourceID`),
  and `PATCH /api/v1/rids/{id}`. New gRPC `RIDService`
  (`ListRIDs` / `GetRID` / `ListRIDHistory`). New `/rids` web panel
  with the configured ∪ live merge, last-50-calls detail modal, and
  write-mode mutation controls. CC Activity RID chips are now
  clickable links into the detail view. See [docs/radio-ids.md](docs/radio-ids.md).
- **Standard P25 talker-alias voice-channel decoder.** Follow-up to
  #387 closing the second half of issue #376. Phase 1 LDU1 Link
  Control opcodes 0x15 (HEADER) / 0x16 (BLOCK1) / 0x17 (BLOCK2) are
  now reassembled by `phase1.StandardTalkerAliasBuf` (one buffer
  per active voice chain) and published as `KindTalkerAlias` events
  with the call's SourceID; the affiliation tracker stamps the
  decoded alias onto the RID row so it surfaces in
  `/api/v1/rids` and the Radio IDs panel. The existing Motorola
  vendor TSBK form (control channel) is unchanged. Phase 2 voice-MAC
  alias dispatch remains a follow-up.
- **APRS bus event + SQLite log + REST + web panel.** Second
  slice of Phase 5 (#365), building on the protocol layer from
  #381. New `events.KindAPRSPacket` bus event, `aprs_log`
  SQLite table, `storage.APRSLog` bus subscriber (mirrors
  `PagerLog`), `GET /api/v1/aprs/packets?limit=N` REST endpoint,
  and `/aprs` web panel rendering the live packet list (received
  time, src → dst + path, type, body, lat/lon, CRC-OK flag with
  yellow highlight on CRC failure). DSP wiring (Bell-202 AFSK
  demod → HDLC de-stuff → AX.25 framer → packet decoder → bus)
  is the remaining piece and lands in a focused follow-up PR.
- **POCSAG DSP receiver + daemon wiring.** Third slice of Phase 3
  (#365). New `internal/radio/pager/pocsag/receiver` package wires
  the FM demod → rational resampler → integrator-and-slicer → bit
  syncer pipeline together so a tuned SDR's IQ stream now flows
  end-to-end into the pager bus event. New `paging.pocsag` YAML
  section pins SDRs to paging frequencies (`serial` +
  `frequency_hz` + optional `baud_hz`). The daemon retunes the
  SDR on startup, subscribes to the iqtap broker, and runs one
  receiver per configured entry as a non-essential spawn (so a
  misconfigured paging frequency doesn't bring down the trunking
  pipeline). Synthetic-IQ end-to-end test is skipped pending
  real captured fixtures; receiver API surface (Options
  validation, ctx cancel, nil input) is unit-tested. See
  [docs/pocsag.md](docs/pocsag.md) for the configuration knob and
  what's pending (timing-recovery tuning against real fixtures,
  multi-channel-from-one-SDR DDC, FLEX).
- **Wideband channelizer hosts P25 Phase 1 + Phase 2 control
  channels (#385).** A single SDR pinned to a centre frequency can
  now host a P25 trunked control channel inside the wideband
  channelizer, alongside the existing DMR Tier II and Tier III state
  machines. The per-channel wiring uses a small `narrowbandReceiver`
  interface (`Process([]complex64)`) so the engine itself stays
  protocol-agnostic; P25 Phase 1 honours the system's
  `p25_phase1_demod_mode` (C4FM vs CQPSK / LSM) and any
  operator-supplied `P25BandPlan` entries, and P25 Phase 2 reuses the
  existing trellis / RS / interleave / scrambler / clock-mode knobs
  and the PN44 seed derivation so a wideband CC tap decodes
  identically to a dedicated CC dongle. Config validator accepts
  protocol `p25` / `p25-phase2` for wideband channels with the same
  control-channel-membership rule that already applies to DMR Tier
  III. Docs and `config.example.yaml` updated with worked P25
  examples. Voice grants on these protocols still route to the
  daemon's existing physical voice pool — the virtual voice pool
  (next bullet) covers in-window grants.
- **Virtual voice pool on the wideband dongle (#386).** A wideband
  dongle can now also follow trunked voice grants whose frequency
  lands inside its IQ window — DMR Tier III, P25 Phase 1, P25
  Phase 2 — without a separate `role: voice` SDR. New
  `internal/sdr/wbvoice` package: `VirtualTuner` implements both
  `trunking.Tuner` (`SetCenterFreq`, `CanTune`) and
  `composer.IQSource` (`StreamIQ`, `SampleRateHz`). Each tap
  subscribes to the wideband dongle's iqtap broker on demand, runs a
  single-tap DDC at the (target − wideband) offset, and emits 48
  kHz IQ to the composer's existing P25 / DMR voice chains — no
  changes to the receivers themselves. `voicepool.FindFreeForFrequency`
  consults an optional `FrequencyChecker.CanTune` on each free
  device, so a voice grant outside the wideband window passes over
  a virtual tuner and lands on the physical `role: voice` SDR when
  one is configured. One SDR end-to-end for any system whose
  carriers fit in a single 2.4 MHz band.
- **Wideband engine routes IQ + tuning through the iqtap broker
  (#377).** Wideband-only DMR Tier 2 deployments (single SDR,
  `role: wideband`, multiple T2 systems) couldn't render the
  spectrum waterfall because the engine consumed `StreamIQ` from
  the raw device and never fed the broker's fan-out. The wideband
  engine now takes the broker (mirroring the CC decoder wiring) so
  the spectrum panel works on wideband-only deployments. Also seeds
  each broker's sample-rate cache in `wrapIQBrokers` from
  `cfg.SDR.SampleRate` — the pool programs the rate on the raw
  device before the broker wraps it, so `Broker.SetSampleRate`'s
  cache path never ran and frames stamped `sample_rate_hz=0` for
  every device.

### Fixed

- **RTL-SDR cold-boot stall on Windows: deeper recovery for wedged
  clone dongles (issue #333).** The previous fix (#382) mapped
  `ERROR_GEN_FAILURE (0x1F)` to `ErrPipeStalled` and ran one
  clear-halt + re-claim retry, which recovers a stale endpoint halt
  but not a wedged firmware state from a prior crashed process.
  WinUSB `Transport.Reset()` now matches what `libusb_reset_device`
  does on Windows: clear-halt the control endpoint, drop the WinUSB
  handles, then re-open the device via `CreateFile` +
  `WinUsb_Initialize` (a true device-object re-bind, not just a pipe
  reset). The open-time bring-up envelope now allows up to two such
  resets per `Open` with 100 ms / 200 ms backoff, giving clones that
  need two settles to come back a chance to recover before surfacing
  the Zadig / port-choice / `gophertrunk sdr doctor` hint. Healthy
  dongles still open with zero resets and zero delay.
- **RTL-SDR cold-boot stall on Windows now self-recovers (#382).**
  Clone dongles (and some power-marginal hubs) latch the first
  USB_SYSCTL=0x09 vendor-OUT write, then NAK the byte-identical
  second write in `init baseband` step 0 with `ERROR_GEN_FAILURE
  (0x1F)`. The Linux equivalent (`EPIPE`) was already covered by the
  bring-up reset+retry envelope; the Windows path wasn't because (a)
  `ERROR_GEN_FAILURE` wasn't classified as resetable, and (b) the
  WinUSB `Transport.Reset()` was a no-op. WinUSB now clears the
  control-pipe halt via `WinUsb_ResetPipe(0)` (USB
  `CLEAR_FEATURE(ENDPOINT_HALT)`), the new `usb.ErrPipeStalled`
  sentinel keys the existing retry envelope, and a clone-dongle hint
  pointing at Zadig / port choice / `gophertrunk sdr doctor` is
  appended when the second attempt still fails.
- **r82xx setPLL nint encoding limit widened to 268 (closes #264).**
  The overflow guard used `0x3F + 13 = 76`, which only accounts for
  ni's 6-bit width and ignores that si's 2 extra bits also encode
  part of nint (register 0x14 = `ni | si<<6`; nint = `13 + 4*ni + si`).
  The real encoding cap is `13 + 4*0x3F + 0x3 = 268`. With R820T /
  R820T2's 28.8 MHz xtal the VCO range capped nint near 67 so the
  bug was latent; PR #266's correct R828D xtal (16 MHz) halves
  `pllRef` and pushes nint up to ~121 — the guard then rejected
  tunes above ~140 MHz on the V4 dongle, e.g. 153.5875 MHz →
  nint=78 overflows. Regression test pins the nint=78 math for the
  reporter's frequency.
- **CC Activity panel renders super-group patches with member counts
  (closes #374).** `eventToDTO` had no case for `trunking.Patch`,
  so the payload fell through to default and was JSON-marshalled
  with Go's PascalCase names (`SuperGroup`, `Members`, `Add`). The
  CC Activity panel reads snake_case fields (`super_group`,
  `members`, `add`) and was getting `undefined` for all of them —
  hence "super-group 0 · add" on every patch. New `PatchDTO`
  mirrors the established DTO pattern (snake_case JSON tags),
  `eventToDTO` dispatches to it, and the frontend cancel-detect
  honours the wire field (`add: false`) alongside the existing
  legacy fallbacks. SSE wire shape pinned by test using the values
  from the issue report.
- **Actionable "voice pool empty" diagnostic when no `role: voice`
  SDR is attached (closes #379).** When an operator booted with a
  trunked system but no voice SDR, every grant logged "voice pool
  full but no actives" — which read as "pool full" while the pool
  was in fact empty, and gave no clue that a second SDR or a
  wideband channelizer is required. `HandleGrant` now distinguishes
  the two cases: empty pool logs a one-shot actionable WARN
  pointing at [docs/hardware.md](docs/hardware.md) and drops
  subsequent grants at DEBUG; the genuine impossible state
  (devices > 0 but no actives) becomes Error so the bug stays
  visible. A new one-shot startup WARN from `Daemon.Run` surfaces
  the problem before the first grant arrives. Non-trunked
  deployments (POCSAG, conventional FM scanner, wideband T2
  capture-only, baseband recording) still run cleanly because the
  warning is gated on `len(systems) > 0`.

## [v0.2.3] — 2026-05-26

The "multi-consumer SDR + new operator panels" release. The new
iqtap broker (#365) made multi-consumer SDR fan-out possible without
forking IQ streams in each subscriber, which immediately unlocked a
batch of new operator-console capabilities: a Constellation viewer
that renders live IQ scatter alongside decode (#370), a CC Activity
panel that filters the events stream down to control-channel chatter
(#369), a UI-managed Bookmarks frequency manager backed by a new
SQLite table (#368), spectrum-panel click-to-tune + bookmark markers
(#371), a Hamlib `rigctld` TCP server for external amateur tooling
(Cloudlog, GridTracker, PSTRotator, `rigctl(1)` — #367), and a
remote `rtl_tcp` driver mounting any number of remote SDR servers as
virtual tuners alongside locally-attached USB dongles (#366). POCSAG
paging landed as the first two slices of Phase 3 of the
trunking-adjacent feature plan (#365): the BCH(31,21) FEC + codeword
wrapper + numeric / alphanumeric message decoders shipped as a
pure-protocol slice (#372), and the syncer + page assembler + bus /
log / REST / web panel scaffold plugged it into the operator surface
(#373); the DSP receiver wiring landed the following day in v0.2.4.
The wideband channelizer gained DMR Tier III control-channel support
(#363) and per-channel `ClockGain` matching the dedicated-dongle
path (#364) so wideband-hosted DMR repeaters lock as cleanly.
Windows 11 RTL-SDR driver-binding woes got a diagnostic answer
(`gophertrunk sdr doctor` — #359) since Windows has no equivalent
of `USBDEVFS_DISCONNECT`. Airspy R2 open ordering on Windows fixed
(#358) so it stops failing with `device disconnected` when
`sdr list` did detect the dongle. And the stuck voice-chain footgun
(#356) closed: the four voice composers now gate `Engine.Touch` on
actual decoder progress so the 30 s inactivity watchdog can fire
and release the bound voice SDR when transmission stops.

### Added

- **POCSAG syncer + page assembler + bus event + SQLite log +
  web panel.** Second slice of Phase 3 (#365), building on the
  protocol layer landed in #372. The new `pocsag.Syncer`
  consumes a packed bit stream, locks on the POCSAG sync
  codeword (with polarity-inverse fallback so a flipped FM
  demod still works), carves batches, decodes through
  BCH(31,21), and reassembles pages by correlating address +
  message codewords. Pages publish on a new
  `events.KindPagerMessage` bus event; a new SQLite `pager_log`
  table persists them; `GET /api/v1/pager/messages?limit=N`
  returns the most recent rows; `/pagers` web panel renders the
  live list (received time, RIC, function code, encoding, body,
  bit-error count). DSP wiring (FM demod → bit slicer →
  `Syncer.Push`) is the remaining piece and lands in a focused
  follow-up PR. See [docs/pocsag.md](docs/pocsag.md).
- **POCSAG paging protocol layer.** First slice of Phase 3 of the
  trunking-adjacent feature plan (#365). Adds BCH(31,21)
  encode/decode (corrects up to 2 bit errors per codeword) plus
  the POCSAG-specific codeword wrapper (sync `0x7CD215D8` + idle
  `0x7A89C197` recognition, trailing overall-parity check,
  address/message/function decoding), batch carve-up (sync + 16
  codewords × 8 frame slots, full-RIC reconstruction from the
  18-bit address-codeword field + slot index), and the
  numeric (CCIR 584 extended BCD: 0-9, *, U, space, -, ), ( ) +
  alphanumeric (7-bit LSB-first ASCII) message decoders. Pure
  protocol — the DSP wiring (FM demod → bit slicer → sync
  detector → batch decoder → bus event → SQLite log → web/TUI
  panel) lands in a focused follow-up PR. See
  [docs/pocsag.md](docs/pocsag.md).
- **Spectrum panel: click-to-tune + bookmark markers.** Closes the
  click-to-tune TODO from the bookmarks PR (#368). Clicking
  anywhere on the waterfall canvas now posts the bin's centre
  frequency to a new `POST
  /api/v1/spectrum/devices/{serial}/tune` endpoint and the SDR
  retunes immediately. The bookmarks list is polled every 30 s
  and rendered as small cyan ticks across the top of the
  waterfall wherever a bookmark frequency falls inside the visible
  band. Tune goes through the iqtap broker so the frequency stays
  coherent across the spectrum, constellation, rigctld, and CC
  decoder views, and survives `pool.Reacquire`.
- **Constellation viewer.** New web panel at `/constellation` that
  renders a live 2D scatter of decimated IQ samples (2 ksps
  default). Brighter dots = newer samples; reference rings at
  |z|=0.5 and |z|=1.0; per-frame dBFS energy banner. Identifies
  signal shape visually — PSK clusters, FSK arcs, AM rotation,
  noise circles, DC bias, frequency-offset spirals — without
  launching a separate SDR receiver alongside GopherTrunk. Builds
  on the iqtap broker (PR #365) so multiple subscribers share the
  same SDR's IQ stream without disturbing decode.
  `internal/dsp/diag` adds a pure-Go stride decimator + per-frame
  energy estimator; `WS /api/v1/diag/iq?device=...&rate=2000`
  exposes it. See [docs/constellation.md](docs/constellation.md).
- **CC Activity panel.** New web panel at `/cc` that filters the
  events stream down to control-channel chatter: voice grants,
  affiliations, registrations, patches / dynamic regroups, talker
  aliases, CC lock / loss, and call start/end. Per-row rendering
  pulls the right detail out of each payload (talkgroup + source
  + frequency + tags for grants, member count for patches,
  response codes for affiliations, the alias string for talker
  aliases). Kind + system substring filters narrow the view; a
  pause button freezes the display without disconnecting the
  bus. Pure filter view over events already on the bus — no new
  bus kinds or storage.
- **Bookmarks / frequency manager.** UI-managed conventional
  channel list (marine VHF, NOAA weather, FRS/GMRS, repeater
  outputs, public-safety conventional fall-backs) backed by a new
  `bookmarks` table in the daemon's SQLite database. Each row
  carries name, frequency, mode, optional CTCSS / DCS, freeform
  notes, and an operator-defined group tag. REST endpoints under
  `/api/v1/bookmarks` (read open; create / update / delete gated
  the same as every other write route); web panel at
  `/bookmarks`. Mutations publish `bookmark.{created,updated,
  deleted}` events on the bus so SSE / WS subscribers refresh
  without polling.
- **Hamlib `rigctld` TCP server.** Opt-in (`api.rigctld:
  "127.0.0.1:4532"`) endpoint speaking the standard rigctld wire
  protocol so external amateur-radio tooling (Cloudlog,
  GridTracker, PSTRotator, satellite trackers, `rigctl(1)`) can
  read and set the control SDR's frequency without learning the
  GopherTrunk REST API. Implements the ~10 commands real clients
  send (`F` / `f`, `M` / `m`, `V` / `v`, `T` / `t`, `chk_vfo`,
  `dump_state`, `q`); unknown commands return `RPRT -1` per
  Hamlib's "unsupported" convention. RX-only backend — `set_ptt 1`
  is rejected. Tuning routes through the iqtap broker so external
  retunes stay coherent with the spectrum panel's frequency axis
  and survive USB-disconnect cycles. See
  [docs/rigctld.md](docs/rigctld.md).
- **Remote `rtl_tcp` SDRs.** A new `rtltcp` driver mounts any number
  of remote `rtl_tcp` servers as virtual tuners alongside locally-
  attached USB dongles. The driver speaks the well-known librtlsdr
  wire protocol (12-byte `RTL0` header, u8 IQ stream, 5-byte command
  packets) used by SDR++, Gqrx, and OpenWebRX, so any host running
  `rtl_tcp` can publish its dongle to the daemon. Configure under
  `sdr.rtl_tcp` in `config.yaml`; each entry carries `addr`,
  optional `serial`, `role`, `ppm`, `gain`, `bias_tee`, and
  `connect_timeout_ms`. Pool roles, broker fan-out, baseband
  recording, and the live spectrum panel all work against remote
  sources just like local ones. Plaintext on the wire — restrict
  to trusted networks or wrap with SSH/WireGuard/Tailscale. See
  [docs/hardware.md](docs/hardware.md).
- **`role: wideband` SDR devices — one dongle, many DMR Tier II
  repeaters and DMR Tier III control channels.** A single SDR pinned
  to a centre frequency now decodes every conventional DMR repeater
  AND a DMR Tier III control channel inside its IQ bandwidth (e.g.
  several 12.5 kHz carriers within a 2.4 MHz IQ window around
  453 MHz), no extra hardware needed. Add a `role: wideband` entry to
  `sdr.devices` with a `center_freq_hz` and a `channels: [...]` list
  binding each frequency to a `trunking.systems` entry; per channel,
  systems with `protocol: dmr-tier2` get a Tier II `ConventionalChannel`
  state machine, systems with `protocol: dmr` get a Tier III
  `ControlChannel` (channel frequency must match one of the system's
  `control_channels`). T2 and T3 can mix on the same dongle. The
  daemon's `internal/scanner/widebandt2` engine fans the dongle's IQ
  out via the `internal/dsp/tuner` package (DDC-per-channel or shared
  polyphase channelizer, picked by channel count). See
  [`docs/hardware.md` § Sharing one dongle across multiple repeaters](docs/hardware.md)
  and `samples/dmr-tier2-multichannel/`. Tier III voice grants still
  route through the existing physical voice pool (a `role: voice`
  SDR follows the call); decoding T3 voice directly on the wideband
  dongle via a virtual voice pool is the next planned step (landed
  in v0.2.4 as #386).
- **`gophertrunk sdr doctor` — per-dongle driver-binding report.**
  Many Windows 11 users reported their RTL-SDR dongles weren't being
  recognized despite appearing in Device Manager, mirroring the
  Linux kernel-driver collision fixed in v0.2.2. Windows has no
  equivalent of `USBDEVFS_DISCONNECT` (you can't programmatically
  rebind a USB function driver), so the fix is diagnostic rather
  than mechanical: a new `sdr doctor` subcommand walks the OS USB
  tree, reads the bound function driver via SetupAPI
  (`SPDRP_SERVICE` / `SPDRP_DEVICEDESC`) on Windows or the
  interface-0 sysfs symlink on Linux, and prints a row per dongle
  with an actionable next step (run Zadig; pick Interface 0 not
  the composite parent; re-target WinUSB instead of libusbK;
  blacklist `dvb_usb_rtl28xxu`; etc.). Read-only — safe to run as
  a regular user alongside a live daemon.
- **Smarter `WinUsb_Initialize` error on Windows.** The error now
  embeds the currently-bound driver name and points the operator at
  `sdr doctor`, replacing the generic "driver not bound? run Zadig"
  message that gave the user no insight into what to actually fix.
- **Windows 11 driver-binding troubleshooting section** in
  `docs/user-guide-windows.md` § 4.2, covering Core Isolation /
  Memory Integrity, Smart App Control, Driver Signature Enforcement,
  Windows Update DVB-driver re-binding, multi-dongle gotchas,
  composite-device interface selection, libusbK / libusb-win32
  mistakes, USB Selective Suspend, xHCI controller quirks,
  antivirus blocking, Windows S mode, and Group Policy device-install
  restrictions.

### Fixed

- **Wideband DMR receiver loop-gain now matches the single-channel
  ccdecoder path.** The Stage 2 / Stage 3 wideband engine was
  instantiating `dmr/receiver.Receiver` with the default
  `ClockGain: 0.05`, which the existing ccdecoder pipelines
  explicitly lowered (0.015 for Tier II, 0.025 for Tier III) because
  the default doesn't reliably lock the Mueller-Müller clock loop on
  T2/T3 symbol distributions. The wideband engine now picks the
  right value per channel based on the system's tier, so wideband-
  hosted DMR repeaters lock as cleanly as the dedicated-dongle path.
  Verified by a new in-package end-to-end test in
  `internal/scanner/widebandt2/engine_e2e_test.go` that feeds
  synthesized Voice LC Header IQ through the engine and asserts a
  grant event lands on the bus.
- **trunking/composer**: Voice chains no longer keep a call alive
  forever via an unconditional 1 s heartbeat. The four chains
  (P25 Phase 1, P25 Phase 2, DMR, NBFM) now gate `Engine.Touch` on
  actual decoder progress — an LDU / superframe / voice subframe /
  PCM batch — so the 30 s inactivity watchdog can fire and release
  the bound voice SDR when transmission stops. Before this fix a
  stalled decoder (simulcast garbage, vocoder hang) refreshed
  `LastHeardAt` every tick regardless of whether any voice frames
  were decoded, leaving the active call permanently locked on a
  single talkgroup and every subsequent grant logging "no voice
  device available for grant" (issue #356, reporter @KN4MSH).
- **config**: New `trunking.call_timeout_ms` knob lets operators
  tune the watchdog timeout (still 30 s by default). Useful on
  systems with consistently clean signaling (lower for snappier
  teardown) or chatty channels with long transmission pauses
  (higher). Issue #356.
- **airspy**: Defer `SET_SAMPLE_TYPE` from `Open()` to `StreamIQ()`,
  matching libairspy's open ordering (`GET_SAMPLERATES` IN first,
  no vendor OUT during open). Fixes Airspy R2 failing to open on
  Windows with `winusb: WinUsb_ControlTransfer OUT: usb: device
  disconnected` even though `sdr list` detected the device
  (issue #270, reporter @VA7DBI).
- **windows usb backend**: Stop folding `ERROR_GEN_FAILURE` into
  `ErrDeviceGone`. That conflation printed "usb: device
  disconnected" for what is actually a firmware NAK / stalled
  pipe / wrong-driver-bound condition, and actively misled the
  issue #270 reporter. The error now names the Win32 code and
  suggests re-binding via Zadig.

## [v0.2.2] — 2026-05-25

Operational-recovery + Mt Anakie follow-up release. The reporter in
issue #345 — a NESDR SMArt v5 dropping off the USB bus multiple
times per day — was the proving ground for a full USB-disconnect
recovery suite: the bulk-IN reaper-death channel now surfaces silent
stalls through the ccdecoder retry loop, control SDRs reacquire by
serial without a daemon restart, voice SDRs reacquire on grant-time
tune failure, and a new SDR-pool watchdog re-enumerates registered
drivers periodically so a missing serial is re-bound the moment it
reappears. The same Mt Anakie site exposed two more P25 control-
channel gaps that v0.2.1's BCH + TSBK fixes uncovered: the site
broadcasts the TDMA `IdentifierUpdate` opcode (0x33 — v0.2.1 only
wired the VUHF variant 0x34), and grants arrive on channel IDs
before the matching IDEN_UP TSBK lands, so a pending-grant ring
(plus a config-driven band-plan seed for sites that never broadcast
some IDs at all) now drains every grant against the freshly-applied
slot. P25 calls also surface ALGID / KID end-to-end — log lines,
TUI, and both web panels render the algorithm name (`0x84
(AES-256)` / `0x81 (DES-OFB)` / `0xAA (ADP/RC4)`) the instant the
LDU2 Encryption Sync lands rather than just an opaque `enc=true`
flag. Web operator-console polish: empty WACN / SystemID / RFSS /
Site fields in the system detail modal now explain *why* they're
empty (control-channel hunt state). Repo polish: README trimmed
from 2,826 → ~210 lines with the long-form Status and Roadmap
chapters extracted into their own pages, the docs nav surfaces
previously-orphan pages (launcher, live-edits, DMR encryption,
release process), and the Dockerfile bumps to `golang:1.25` so
builds stop silently downloading the newer toolchain at every run.

### Added

- **TDMA `IdentifierUpdate` (TSBK opcode 0x33) wired through the
  Phase 1 dispatcher (issue #345).** v0.2.1 added the FDMA-
  flavoured VUHF variant (0x34, channel IDs 2 / 3 / 4 / 6 / 7 /
  8 / 14 / 15); the Mt Anakie site survey confirmed it broadcasts
  IDEN_UP for id=10 only as the TDMA variant (0x33, covering ids
  0 / 1 / 5 / 9 / 11 / 12 / 13), which the dispatcher silently
  ignored. Every Phase 2 grant on a TDMA id was black-holing with
  `decode.error stage=no-bandplan`. `ParseIdentifierUpdateTDMA`
  mirrors the VUHF bit packing (the on-air frequency-field layout
  per TIA-102.AABF Table 14 is identical; only byte 0's lower
  nibble differs — channel-type code vs bandwidth code), and
  channel-type → bandwidth mapping covers the documented Phase 2
  codes (0x1 → 6.25 kHz, 0x2 → 12.5 kHz, 0x3 → 6.25 kHz). Mt
  Anakie id=10 + num=176 now resolves to 468.6125 MHz.

- **Per-channel-ID deferred grant queue (issue #345).** Grants
  that reference a `BandPlan` channel ID before the matching
  `IdentifierUpdate` TSBK lands are now held in a bounded ring
  (cap 4 per ID, 5 s TTL) instead of dropping with
  `decode.error stage=no-bandplan`. When the IDEN_UP arrives the
  ring drains and re-publishes every queued grant through
  `publishVoiceGrant` against the freshly-applied slot. Covers
  the race where IDEN_UP cadence is slower than the first grant
  after CC lock.

- **Config-driven P25 band-plan seed.** New `p25_band_plan` list
  on `SystemConfig` with `channel_id` / `base_hz` / `spacing_hz`
  / `tx_offset_hz` / `bandwidth_hz` fields, validated for range
  and duplicates. The Phase 1 pipeline factory calls
  `BandPlan.Apply` for each entry at startup so sites that never
  broadcast IDEN_UP for a given channel ID can still resolve
  grants. Over-the-air IDEN_UPs override seeded entries through
  the same `Apply` path — entries are a floor, not a ceiling.

- **P25 ALGID / KID encryption metadata surfaced end-to-end
  (closes #353).** Phase 2 was already populating `Grant.ALGID`
  / `KID` but nothing downstream consumed them; Phase 1 carried
  them as zero until the LDU2 Encryption Sync arrived after
  voice acquisition. A new `KindCallEncryption` event lets the
  voice composer publish ALGID/KID the instant the LDU2 lands;
  the engine updates the bound `ActiveCall.Grant` via a new
  `VoicePool.UpdateEncryption` helper and republishes through
  the events bus. Wire-format additions cover REST/SSE
  (`GrantDTO`, `CallEncryptionDTO`), gRPC (pb `Grant` message),
  the TUI client mirror, and the web SPA (`GrantDTO`,
  `CallRow`, new `CallEncryptionEvent`). A new P25 algorithm-
  name registry renders `0x84 (AES-256)` / `0x81 (DES-OFB)` /
  `0xAA (ADP/RC4)` uniformly across the log line, the TUI
  active-call flag column, and both web panels' pills + detail
  views. Storage schema already had the columns.

- **SDR-pool periodic watchdog + voice-pool reacquire hook
  (issue #345).** Following the control-SDR re-acquire path
  shipped in PR #349, the same recovery now extends to voice
  dongles and to idle devices. When `VoicePool.Bind`'s
  `SetCenterFreq` fails — typically because a voice dongle
  disconnected between calls — the pool's new reacquire hook
  (wired by the daemon to `sdr.Pool.Reacquire`) re-opens the
  device by serial, swaps the fresh `Tuner` into the
  `VoiceDevice`, and retries the tune once before the call
  drops. Independently, the SDR pool runs a periodic watchdog
  (`sdr.watchdog_interval_ms`, default 30 s, opt-out via `-1`)
  that re-enumerates registered drivers, surfaces missing
  serials via `KindSDRDetached`, and calls `Pool.Reacquire` the
  moment a previously-missing serial reappears — so the next
  consumer touches a live handle instead of paying the
  reacquire round-trip mid-use. The watchdog only acts on the
  missing → reappeared transition: continuously-present devices
  are never touched.

- **Empty WACN / SystemID / RFSS / Site fields on the web
  systems detail modal now explain *why* they're empty (#342).**
  Those four identity fields populate from decoded P25 status
  broadcasts (TSBK 0x3A / 0x3B), not config, so they're empty
  until the control channel is locked and the broadcasts
  arrive. The detail modal used to show a bare em-dash, leaving
  operators unable to tell config mistakes from "not yet
  decoded". The scanner snapshot (`hunting` / `locked` / other)
  now drives per-field hint copy through a new `DetailField`
  `emptyHint` prop, pulled from the Systems-panel poll so the
  hint stays correct without visiting the Scanner page first.

### Fixed

- **Control SDR USB disconnect / re-enumerate now recovers
  in-process without a daemon restart (issue #345).** PR #348
  surfaced the silent-stall failure through the ccdecoder retry
  loop and escalated to a fatal exit so systemd / docker could
  restart the process; on a dongle that disconnects repeatedly
  (the reporter in issue #345 saw multiple drops per day on a
  NESDR SMArt v5) that meant the daemon kept exiting. The retry
  loop now first asks the `sdr.Pool` to re-acquire the control
  device by serial: best-effort close of the dead handle,
  driver re-enumerate, fresh `Open()` by the new USB index,
  sample rate + per-device Hint (PPM, gain, bias-tee) re-
  applied to the new handle, `Device` swapped in place in the
  `PoolEntry`, and `KindSDRDetached` + `KindSDRAttached` events
  republished so the API / TUI / web snapshot reflect the
  swap. `cchunt.Supervisor.SwapTuner` feeds the fresh handle to
  in-flight hunters by closing any armed retune channels so the
  next hunt round picks up the new tuner. The existing
  1 s / 2 s / 5 s / 10 s retry budget still applies — if the
  device stays gone after re-enumerate or `Open` fails, retries
  exhaust and the daemon still escalates to a clean fatal for
  the supervisor restart path.

- **`ccdecoder.StreamIQ` open-time errors now classify as
  `ErrIQStreamClosed` so the retry loop recovers (issue #345).**
  After the v0.2.1 retry path shipped, the reporter still saw
  the daemon's ccdecoder silently exit on a real RTL-SDR USB
  disconnect: the reaper would die mid-stream returning
  `ErrIQStreamClosed`, the retry loop would rebuild the decoder
  against the same dead `Tuner`, the rebuilt `StreamIQ` would
  fail with `usb: device disconnected` at the control-transfer
  `ResetBuffer` step, and the retry loop's `errors.Is` against
  `ErrIQStreamClosed` would miss. Non-context `StreamIQ` open
  errors are now wrapped as `%w: %w` against
  `ErrIQStreamClosed` so both shapes (mid-stream EOF and
  open-time `device disconnected`) classify the same way; the
  underlying error stays inspectable via `errors.Is` for the
  root cause.

- **USB bulk-IN reaper death now surfaces to the decoder
  instead of stalling silently (issue #345).** The shared
  bulk-IN reaper goroutine on every platform (linux / windows
  / darwin) used to exit silently when every URB became
  unrecoverable, leaving the driver's IQ consumer channel
  neither sending nor closed. ccdecoder's `select` blocked on
  the dead stream forever, `decoder.pump` stopped running, and
  every downstream `events.Publish` froze — the daemon went
  idle at 0% CPU with `gophertrunk_events_total` counters
  stuck, alive but inert. A new
  `usb.Transport.StartBulkIn.onStreamDead` callback fires
  exactly once when the reaper exits without `StopBulkIn`;
  each hardware driver (purego / airspy / airspyhf / hackrf)
  wires it into its existing cleanup goroutine via a
  `streamDead` channel + `sync.Once` so the consumer channel
  always closes — exactly once — on either ctx-cancel or
  reaper death. `ccdecoder.Run` then returns
  `ErrIQStreamClosed` on unexpected EOF, hitting the backoff-
  driven restart loop above (1 s / 2 s / 5 s / 10 s, with the
  attempt counter reset after a 60 s healthy run).

### Changed

- **README trimmed from 2,826 → ~210 lines.** The long-form
  "Status & known gaps" extracted into a new `docs/status.md`,
  the "Roadmap" into a new `docs/roadmap.md`, and the inline
  "Recently shipped" log removed because it duplicated
  `CHANGELOG.md`. Chapters that already live under `docs/` (TUI,
  Web console, API auth, FEC opt-outs, Repository layout,
  encyclopedic Quick Start) are now linked rather than
  duplicated. Nav (`docs/_data/nav.yml`) surfaces previously-
  orphan pages: launcher, live-edits, DMR encryption, release,
  and the new status / roadmap pages. Added Jekyll front matter
  to `launcher.md` and `dmr-encryption.md` so they render under
  the right group.

- **Dockerfile bumped `golang:1.24` → `golang:1.25`** to match
  `go.mod`'s Go 1.25.0 / toolchain 1.25.10. Builds were
  silently downloading the newer toolchain at every run.
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` bumps "Go 1.24+" → "Go 1.25+" to match.
  `.gitignore` now excludes `.env` / `.env.*` since
  contributors occasionally drop streaming credentials there
  while iterating. A new minimal
  `.github/pull_request_template.md` covers scope, test plan,
  breaking changes, and the docs/CHANGELOG checklist.

## [v0.2.1] — 2026-05-24

P25-on-live-air follow-up release, fixing every NID/TSBK-decode
bug that surfaced once real captures from the Mt Anakie site
went through the pipeline that landed in v0.2.0. The BCH(63,16,11)
generator polynomial is now spec-correct (was wrong by 10 exponents
against TIA-102.BAAA Annex A — synthetic round-trip tests had passed
because encoder + decoder shared the same wrong polynomial), the
TSBK CRC verifier switches to the augmented variant per TIA-102.AABF
(the previous CRC-CCITT/FALSE rejected clean Viterbi output), and
the VHF / UHF `IdentifierUpdateVUHF` band-plan opcode (0x34) is
wired into the dispatcher so UHF P25 sites resolve grants without
stalling on `no-bandplan`. A new C4FM symbol-AGC keeps the matched-
filter outer-symbol centres scaled correctly on real RTL-SDR
captures, and the offline `gophertrunk replay` / `iq-diag` tool
grows a TSBK dump + per-instance NID-search span so stubborn
captures are debuggable without a radio on the bench. Operator-
visible polish: the daemon's blank 404 at `/` (when a binary was
built without first running `make web-build`) now serves an HTML
page explaining the fix; `make dist` is the one-shot build target
that always embeds the SPA; duplicate SDR serials in `sdr.devices`
are caught at config-validation time with both indices named;
WinUSB `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` on Windows gets a remediation hint
pointing at other SDR apps; `internal/version` now auto-stamps
from Go's VCS info on a bare `go build`, so the version string is
no longer a useless `dev` when an operator skipped `make build`.

### Added

- **P25 Phase 1 `IdentifierUpdateVUHF` (TSBK opcode 0x34) wired
  through the dispatcher — UHF P25 sites resolve voice grants
  without stalling on `no-bandplan`.** The 0x34 opcode constant
  was already defined in `internal/radio/p25/phase1/opcodes.go`,
  but it had no parser and no `switch` case, so `IDEN_UP_VUHF`
  TSBKs arriving from a VHF / UHF site were silently dropped —
  the `BandPlan` stayed empty and every subsequent
  `GroupVoiceChannelGrant` emitted `decode.error
  stage=no-bandplan`. The CC lock itself worked fine; the failure
  was downstream of the lock and invisible without inspecting the
  events bus. `ParseIdentifierUpdateVUHF` /
  `AssembleIdentifierUpdateVUHF` decode the VHF/UHF bit packing
  per TIA-102.AABF Table 14a (4-bit `BW` lookup → 6.25 / 12.5 kHz
  per Table 16, 1-bit sign + 13-bit magnitude `TxOffset` whose
  unit is the channel step rather than a fixed 250 kHz, plus the
  same 10-bit `STEP × 125 Hz` and 32-bit `FREQ × 5 Hz` as the
  0x3D variant) and populate the existing `IdentifierUpdate`
  struct, so `BandPlan.Apply` / `BandPlan.Frequency` need no
  change. Cross-checked bit-by-bit against OP25
  (`op25/gr-op25_repeater/apps/trunking.py` `iden_up vhf uhf`)
  and SDRTrunk (`FrequencyBandUpdateVUHF.java`). Round-trip tests
  cover both negative offset (the typical UHF -5 MHz case) and
  positive offset (sign-bit coverage); a new end-to-end test
  feeds a VUHF `IdentifierUpdate` plus a subsequent grant through
  the real `ControlChannel.Process` chain and asserts the grant
  resolves to the expected frequency rather than falling to
  `decode.error`.

- **C4FM symbol-AGC on the P25 Phase 1 receive path (issue
  #275).** The P25 receive filter (`P25C4FMRxTaps`) is normalised
  to a DC gain of `sps`, so on real RTL-SDR captures the matched-
  filter outer-symbol centres land at `sps × 2π·deviation /
  sampleRate` radians — orders of magnitude larger than the
  ±3/±1 dibit decision boundaries the slicer expects. A per-
  symbol AGC now scales the matched-filter output back into the
  slicer's expected range, which is what made the BCH-decode
  fixes below visible on live air rather than just on synthetic
  modulator round-trip tests.

- **Offline `gophertrunk replay` / `iq-diag` tool grows TSBK dump
  + per-instance NID-search span (issue #275).** `replay -in
  capture.iq -diag` now appends the first 24 TSBK dibits at each
  perfect-distance FSW, which distinguishes a periodic fixed
  beacon (identical NID + identical TSBK) from a real CC
  (identical NID + varying TSBK) without running the trellis
  decoder. A new `-nid-search-span N` flag widens the
  NID-alignment search beyond the production default (±6 dibits)
  as a bisect knob for stubborn captures; the production
  `ccdecoder` is unchanged (zero in `Options` falls back to the
  default span). The tool is now documented in the README and
  `docs/hardware.md` so operators can use it without re-reading
  source.

- **`make dist` one-shot release-build target.** `make dist`
  runs `web-build` then `build` so the daemon binary always
  embeds the SPA; `make cross-build`, `make release-dry-run`,
  and `make run` now depend on `web-build` for the same reason.
  Closes the v0.1.x footgun where `go build ./cmd/gophertrunk`
  without first running `make web-build` produced a binary that
  silently 404'd at `/` (see Fixed below).

### Fixed

- **P25 Phase 1 BCH(63,16,11) generator polynomial was wrong by
  10 exponents against TIA-102.BAAA Annex A (issue #275).**
  `bch6316Generator` was `0xF391E2F34B99`; the spec polynomial —
  the product of the minimal polynomials of α, α³, α⁵, …, α²¹
  over GF(2⁶) with primitive `p(x) = x⁶ + x + 1` — is
  `0xCD930BDD3B2B`. Synthetic-modulator round-trip tests passed
  because the encoder and decoder both used the wrong polynomial,
  so the bug was invisible until the Mt Anakie capture went
  through the live pipeline (197/197 NID failures with the wrong
  polynomial, 195/197 clean decodes with the spec one). Per-DUID
  parity tables are now derived from the spec polynomial as well.
  A test shim with the old wrong polynomial hardcoded inline has
  been removed from `motorola/process_test.go` so the test
  exercises the same code path the daemon does.

- **P25 Phase 1 TSBK CRC verifier now uses the spec-correct
  augmented variant per TIA-102.AABF (issue #275).** The original
  trailer code used the "CRC-CCITT/FALSE" variant (init=0xFFFF,
  no final XOR, trailer stored inverted). The P25 spec — cross-
  checked against OP25 (`crc16_ccitt_xor`) and SDRTrunk
  (`CRCP25.checkCRCCCITT`) — uses the **augmented** variant
  (init=0xFFFF, the trailer participates in the LFSR shift, no
  final XOR or inversion). With PR #337's BCH polynomial fix
  alone, the Mt Anakie capture's TSBKs all came out of the
  trellis decoder with metric=0 (clean Viterbi path) but still
  failed CRC; with this fix the CRC verifier agrees with the
  trellis decoder and the TSBKs actually decode.

- **Motorola Type II patch members no longer emitted as
  triplicated talkgroup IDs (`[32501 32501 32501]`) — issue
  #275.** Audit ruled out a parser bug: `AsMotorolaPatchGroup`
  correctly reads three independent 16-bit fields, and the
  on-air payload bytes really are `0x7EF5` triplicated (Motorola
  pads short patch lists with the first member). The parser now
  deduplicates members on parse so a one-member patch is reported
  as one member instead of three.

- **Daemon now serves a helpful HTML page (not a blank stdlib
  404) at `/` when the SPA isn't embedded (issue #290).**
  `//go:embed all:dist` snapshots `web/dist/` at Go compile time,
  so a binary built without first running `make web-build`
  embeds only the `.gitkeep` sentinel and silently 404s at `/`.
  The 404 body now explains the cause and points at `make dist`;
  status code stays 404 so proxies/healthchecks are unaffected.
  Combined with the new `make dist` target above, the case
  shouldn't arise for release binaries.

- **`sdr.devices` config now rejects duplicate device serials at
  validation time (issue #333).** A Windows user listed the same
  RTL-SDR serial twice (control + voice) and the pool silently
  collapsed the hint, leaving WinUSB to fail the second
  `CreateFile` with `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` ("Toegang
  geweigerd") — a cryptic OS-level error that obscured a config
  mistake. `config.Validate()` now rejects duplicate serials in
  `sdr.devices` with a message naming both offending indices and
  explaining the one-SDR-per-role rule, and the RTL-SDR USB open
  path emits a remediation hint on Windows
  `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` pointing at other SDR apps that might
  be holding the dongle.

- **`internal/version` auto-stamps from Go's VCS info on a bare
  `go build` (issue #275).** Without the Makefile's `-ldflags`
  injection the version package stayed at its zero defaults
  (`Version="dev"`, `Commit=""`, `BuildTime=""`) and the
  `ccdecoder: p25/phase1 pipeline configured` log line printed
  `build=dev` even when source HEAD was a real commit. The
  package now falls back to `debug.ReadBuildInfo()` for both
  commit and build time when ldflags were not set, so issue-#275
  retest cycles where operators paste log excerpts always carry
  identifying build provenance. The Makefile-injected values
  still take precedence in production / release builds.

- **`TestDaemonCCDecodesDPMR` integration deadline is no longer
  flaky under `-race`.** dPMR runs at half the symbol rate the
  sibling P25 / DMR / NXDN tests use (2400 vs 4800 sym/s), so
  the same mock-SDR IQ chunk carries half the dibits per second
  and the cold-start path occasionally exceeded the 5 s lock
  deadline on slower hardware (~3% under `-race`). The deadline
  is now 30 s; steady-state lock time is still ~0.4 s, so the
  bump only affects worst-case slow paths.

## [v0.2.0] — 2026-05-23

SDR-fleet + DMR-voice + P25-lock release. The pure-Go SDR
backend grows from RTL-SDR-only into a full fleet — HackRF One
/ Jawbreaker / Rad1o, Airspy R2 / Mini, and the entire Airspy
HF+ family all gain native drivers with no `libhackrf` /
`libairspy` / `libairspyhf` at build or runtime, so the
single-static-binary guarantee holds across every supported
front-end. DMR gains its missing voice path: an AMBE+2 3600 ×
2450 vocoder decodes Tier II / Tier III voice superframes to
WAV. P25 Phase 1 control-channel lock on live air gets the
final attention pass it needed — NID-alignment search after
FSW, TSBK-CRC corroboration for marginal NIDs, restricted C4FM
rotation set, and a per-dibit error-pattern diagnostic that
makes lock failures debuggable from the log. A new
`gophertrunk replay` subcommand decodes captured wideband IQ
offline so issue triage doesn't need a radio on the bench.
RTL-SDR's classic "device busy" failure mode is gone — the USB
layer now auto-detaches the bound `dvb_usb_rtl28xxu` kernel
driver the way `libusb` does for `librtlsdr`, so the daemon
opens dongles out of the box without first blacklisting the
DVB module.

### Added

- **Airspy HF+ Discovery / Dual Port / legacy HF+ pure-Go driver.**
  New `internal/sdr/airspyhf` package implements the `sdr.Driver` /
  `sdr.Device` interfaces on top of the same pure-Go USB transport
  (USBDEVFS / WinUSB / IOKit) the RTL-SDR / HackRF / Airspy drivers
  use — no `libairspyhf` at build or runtime, the zero-CGO
  single-binary guarantee still holds. The driver speaks the
  documented libairspyhf USB vendor protocol (RECEIVER_MODE,
  SET_FREQ, GET_SAMPLERATES, SET_HF_AGC, SET_HF_ATT, SET_HF_LNA,
  SET_BIAS_TEE, GET_VERSION_STRING) and decodes the HF+'s
  interleaved int16 IQ payload into complex64. All three known
  variants (Discovery, Dual Port, legacy) enumerate on VID:PID
  `0x03eb:0x800c`; the USB descriptor's Product string drives the
  `TunerName` distinction. Coverage: 9 kHz – 31 MHz HF + 60 –
  260 MHz VHF; HF AGC plus a 0–48 dB attenuator (6 dB steps) and
  +6 dB LNA preamp. Registered on init so a blank import from
  `cmd/gophertrunk` is the only wiring needed. The wire protocol
  is unit-tested against `usb.MockTransport`; on-air validation
  against attached HF+ hardware is the documented follow-up.

- **HackRF firmware-aware identification.** The HackRF driver now
  reads `BOARD_ID_READ` and `VERSION_STRING_READ` at Open time and
  uses the firmware's self-reported identity (rather than the USB
  descriptor's Product string) to populate `sdr.Info.Product` as
  `HackRF One` / `HackRF Jawbreaker` / `Rad1o`. The running
  firmware version is appended to `TunerName` (`MAX2839+MAX5864
  (fw git-2024.02.1)`), and PortaPack / Mayhem builds are
  auto-detected and tagged with `+ PortaPack` so the operator can
  see at a glance which board is on which USB port. `Enumerate`
  also normalises Product based on the PID, so listings are
  consistent even before Open.

- **Airspy R2 vs Mini distinction in `TunerName`.** The Airspy
  driver now detects the `MINI` substring in the USB Product
  string at enumeration time and emits `R820T (Airspy R2)` or
  `R820T (Airspy Mini)` accordingly. Both variants share the same
  VID:PID, same R820T tuner, and same wire protocol — the split
  surfaces purely through the operator-visible label so multi-
  dongle pools can pick the right unit by name.

- **HackRF One and Airspy R2 / Mini pure-Go drivers.** New
  `internal/sdr/hackrf` and `internal/sdr/airspy` packages implement
  the `sdr.Driver` / `sdr.Device` interfaces on top of the same
  pure-Go USB transport (USBDEVFS / WinUSB / IOKit) the RTL-SDR
  driver uses — no `libhackrf` or `libairspy` at build or runtime,
  so the zero-CGO single-binary guarantee holds. The drivers speak
  the documented libhackrf and libairspy USB vendor protocols
  (transceiver / receiver mode, frequency, sample rate, LNA / VGA /
  mixer / amp / bias-tee gains, bulk-IN sample reaper with real-time
  decode of HackRF int8 IQ and Airspy INT16_IQ into complex64). Both
  register themselves with the SDR driver registry on init, so a
  blank import from `cmd/gophertrunk` is the only wiring needed. The
  wire protocols are unit-tested against `usb.MockTransport`; on-air
  validation against attached HackRF / Airspy hardware is the
  documented follow-up.

- **DMR voice decodes to playable WAV (issue #276).** The DMR
  voice path is now end-to-end: a Tier II / Tier III voice
  superframe decoder slices the AMBE+2 burst layout into the
  three 49-bit voice frames per burst, and a clean-room pure-Go
  AMBE+2 3600 × 2450 vocoder takes the on-air FEC-protected
  frames through soft-decision deinterleave → Golay(23,12,7) +
  Hamming(15,11,3) FEC → b₀…b₈ parameter extraction → MBE
  synthesis → 8 kHz PCM. The composer wires the chain into the
  recorder so a DMR voice grant now produces a WAV instead of an
  empty `.raw` sidecar. Encrypted DMR voice calls are detected
  (PI header keyword + signalling-flag check), tagged on the
  call record, and logged so an operator can tell at a glance
  why a recording is silent.

- **`gophertrunk replay` subcommand for offline IQ decoding.**
  A new top-level subcommand mounts a wideband IQ recording (the
  two-channel 16-bit WAV layout the daemon writes, or
  SDRtrunk's) into the SDR pool as a virtual tuner and runs the
  full decode pipeline against it with no radio attached. Issue
  triage (especially for #275) can now reproduce a control-
  channel-lock failure off a customer-supplied capture instead
  of needing the original site on the bench.

- **P25 Phase 1 control-channel lock on live air (issue #275).**
  Four targeted fixes to the NID acquisition path: (1) the
  alignment search now sweeps across symbols after the FSW
  rather than assuming bit-exact synchrony, fixing a class of
  marginal sites that previously never locked; (2) NID
  candidates with one or two residual bit errors are
  corroborated against the next TSBK's CRC before being accepted
  or rejected, so a single noisy NID dibit no longer drops the
  whole superframe; (3) the C4FM rotation set is restricted to
  the four physically realisable dibit phases, eliminating false
  locks on rotated noise; (4) on NID failure the decoder logs
  the per-dibit error pattern so a capture-driven debugger can
  see which specific symbols disagreed with the expected NID.
  At startup the `ccdecoder` now logs its NID-search parameters
  so the parameters used on a given run are visible in the log
  without having to read source.

- **DMR encryption guide.** A new
  [`docs/dmr-encryption.md`](docs/dmr-encryption.md) page
  documents the DMR encryption landscape (basic + enhanced
  privacy, ARC4 vs AES, key-management), what GopherTrunk does
  detect (the PI header, the signalling-flag bit, vendor key
  IDs) and what it deliberately does not do (decrypt without an
  operator-supplied key), with worked log examples.

### Fixed

- **RTL-SDR dongles now open even with the DVB kernel driver still
  bound.** On Linux the kernel binds `dvb_usb_rtl28xxu` (the DVB-T
  TV-tuner driver) to RTL-SDR dongles at plug time. An operator who
  hadn't blacklisted that module saw the daemon fail every device
  with `open device failed … claim interface 0: device or resource
  busy` followed by `SDR pool open failed … no SDR devices opened` —
  even though `sdr list` (which only reads USB descriptors) happily
  showed the dongles. The USB layer now detaches the bound kernel
  driver and retries the claim — the same auto-detach-kernel-driver
  behaviour `librtlsdr` gets from libusb — so GopherTrunk opens the
  dongle out of the box. Blacklisting the module is still recommended
  (it stops the kernel grabbing the device first) but no longer
  required. A claim error that survives the auto-detach now carries a
  hint that another user-space process is holding the dongle.
- **Empty talkgroup CSV no longer reported as a load failure.** A
  talkgroup CSV that existed but was empty (a freshly-touched
  placeholder, or a system whose talkgroups aren't catalogued yet)
  made the daemon log a scary `WARN talkgroup load failed … err="read
  csv header: EOF"`. An empty file is a legitimate "no talkgroups"
  state: `LoadCSV` now loads it cleanly as zero records, and preflight
  surfaces an actionable `talkgroup_file … is empty` warning instead.

## [v0.1.8] — 2026-05-21

P25 reception + voice-path release. The bulk of the work makes
trunked control-channel decode actually lock on live RTL-SDR
hardware (issue #275): IQ-stream channelization, cross-chunk
frame assembly, symbol-clock chunk-boundary fixes, a CQPSK / LSM
demodulator path with a blind equalizer and AGC for simulcast
sites, and coarse AFC for tuner carrier offset. On top of that,
P25 Phase 1 and Phase 2 are built out to functional SDRtrunk
parity with working voice decoding, and DMR gains a voice
decoding path (issue #276) where it previously decoded control
channels only. The web console's connect-time render loop and
WebSocket reconnect storm (issue #290) are both fixed.

### Added

- **Protocol-agnostic affiliation tracker.** A new
  `trunking.AffiliationTracker` maintains a live "which radio unit
  is on which talkgroup" table, fed by `KindGrant` (the grant's
  source/group is ground truth), explicit `KindAffiliation` events,
  and `KindUnitRegistration`. Because every protocol's grant carries
  a source and group, the table works uniformly across P25, DMR
  (all tiers and vendors) and NXDN with no per-protocol decoding.
  Idle units expire after a TTL. Served at `GET /api/v1/affiliations`.
- **Per-talkgroup mute and icon assignment.** A talkgroup can carry
  a `mute` flag (suppresses its calls from the live audio player
  while still following, recording and streaming them) and an
  `icon` name (the data model behind SDRtrunk's Icon Manager) — set
  via CSV column, JSON field, or `PATCH /api/v1/talkgroups/{id}`,
  and surfaced in the talkgroup API DTO.
- **Analog-trunking voice decoding.** Motorola Type II / SmartZone,
  EDACS, LTR and MPT 1327 calls now decode to audio through the
  composer's FM voice chain — they carry plain narrowband FM, so the
  existing FM chain is the correct decoder. EDACS ProVoice (digital,
  patent-encumbered) stays on the `.raw` sidecar path.
- **Outbound call streaming to aggregators and live audio
  servers.** Completed calls are now encoded to MP3 and streamed
  to external services, closing the largest functional gap
  against SDRtrunk. A new `internal/broadcast` subsystem
  subscribes to a `KindCallComplete` event the recorder
  publishes once a call's WAV is flushed, encodes the audio via
  a pure-Go MP3 encoder (`internal/voice/mp3`, no CGO), and
  fans the call out to every configured backend with bounded
  exponential-backoff retry. Four backends ship: Broadcastify
  Calls (two-step metadata + audio upload), RdioScanner
  (native call-upload API), OpenMHz, and live Icecast/ShoutCast
  (a continuous paced source connection topped up with silence
  between calls). Feeds are configured under a new `broadcast:`
  config section; each feed takes an optional `systems:` filter
  and a talkgroup can opt out of all feeds with `stream: false`
  in its CSV/JSON. Feed counters are exposed at
  `GET /api/v1/broadcast`.
- **Per-talkgroup recording assignment.** A talkgroup can now be
  flagged `record: false` (CSV column, JSON field, or
  `PATCH /api/v1/talkgroups/{id}`) to follow and play its calls live
  while writing no WAV/raw files for it — the recording analogue of
  the `stream` opt-out. Both `stream` and `record` are now surfaced
  in the talkgroup API DTO and accepted by the PATCH endpoint.
- **Decoded-message log.** A new optional `MessageLog`
  (`internal/log`) writes a human-readable, timestamped text log of
  every trunking event the bus carries — grants, control-channel
  lock/loss, affiliations, registrations, patches, talker aliases,
  locations, tone alerts, decode errors — the GopherTrunk analogue
  of SDRtrunk's per-channel decoded message log. The file rotates to
  `<path>.1` past a configurable size cap. Enabled via a new
  `log.message_log` config block.
- **GPS / location subsystem.** Geographic fixes a subscriber unit
  reports over the air now flow through a new `KindLocation` event
  (`trunking.Location` payload) to a `location_log` SQLite table and
  out via `GET /api/v1/locations` for map display. A new
  `internal/radio/location` package implements a strict NMEA-0183
  GGA/RMC parser — the format Tait CCDI and many MOTOTRBO GPS
  profiles transport verbatim — with checksum verification. The
  per-protocol binary GPS PDU extractors (P25 Motorola Unit GPS,
  L3Harris Talker GPS, DMR LRRP) and the web map page build on this
  backbone; their bit-exact wiring is pending capture validation.
- **DMR vendor-trunking recognition (FID-aware CSBK dispatch).**
  The Tier III control-channel decoder now dispatches each CSBK on
  its feature-set ID (FID) before opcode, so a Motorola or Hytera
  vendor CSBK is no longer misdecoded against the standard ETSI
  opcode table — previously a vendor CSBK whose 6-bit opcode
  collided with `0x30` would emit a bogus voice grant. Motorola
  Capacity Plus / Capacity Max voice grants (FID 0x10), which carry
  the ETSI-shaped 8-octet payload, now decode to real grants, and
  the Capacity Plus rest channel is tracked from its system-info
  CSBK. Connect Plus and Hytera XPT CSBKs are recognised and routed
  to a vendor handler; bit-exact decoding of those proprietary
  payloads is pending on-air capture validation.
- **Wideband baseband (IQ) recording and offline replay.** A new
  `internal/sdr/baseband` package adds two capabilities SDRtrunk
  has and GopherTrunk lacked. A `RecordingDevice` decorator tees a
  live tuner's IQ stream to a two-channel 16-bit WAV (in-phase in
  channel 1, quadrature in channel 2 — the same layout as
  SDRtrunk's baseband recordings). A `FileDriver` mounts those
  recordings (and SDRtrunk's) back into the SDR pool as virtual
  tuners, so a capture can be decoded offline with no radio
  attached; replay loops on EOF to behave like a continuous
  source. Both are configured under a new `baseband:` config
  section (`record:` and `replay:` lists).
- **P25 Phase 1 voice decoding and broader control-channel
  coverage** (PR #310). A `p25` voice grant now decodes
  end-to-end — modulated C4FM IQ → Phase 1 receiver → LDU
  assembly → IMBE voice frames → WAV; the composer previously
  bypassed the P25 Phase 1 voice path and produced no audio.
  The control-channel decoder gains wider TSBK grant coverage
  (unit-to-unit voice grant, explicit/implicit group update,
  telephone-interconnect grant, SNDCP data-channel grant),
  manufacturer-specific TSBK dispatch by MFID (Motorola /
  Harris group-regroup, multi-fragment vendor talker alias),
  LDU1 Link Control and LDU2 Encryption Sync decode (algorithm
  and key ID surfaced — identify, not decrypt), a `NetworkModel`
  that accumulates system topology (WACN, RFSS / site IDs,
  secondary control channels, neighbour sites), and a
  packet-data decode layer (PDU reassembly → SNDCP → IPv4
  header). Patch / regroup and talker-alias announcements
  publish through the new `KindPatch` / `KindTalkerAlias` event
  kinds.
- **P25 Phase 2 TDMA decode path** (PR #308, #309). P25 Phase 2
  grew from a control-channel-only stub into a full TDMA
  decoder. A `SuperframeDecoder` locks the 360 ms superframe and
  slices its 12 sub-frames; SlotType decode separates voice from
  MAC sub-frames; `ExtractVoiceFrames` pulls AMBE+2 frames from
  4V / 2V voice slots; and a composer voice chain decodes a
  `p25-phase2` grant end-to-end (modulated IQ → receiver →
  superframe decode → AMBE+2 → WAV). The live control-channel
  pipeline now runs through the structured `SuperframeDecoder`.
  Parity additions: encryption identification (`Encrypted` /
  `Emergency` / `AlgorithmID` / `KeyID` on the grant), Motorola /
  Harris patch / regroup feeding an engine `PatchRegistry`,
  multi-fragment talker-alias reassembly, band-plan
  channel-to-frequency resolution, MFID-keyed vendor MAC
  dispatch, and the opt-in TIA-102.BBAC per-burst block
  deinterleaver (`p25_phase2_interleave_mode`). Phase 2 now
  emits `KindAffiliation` / `KindUnitRegistration` / `KindPatch`
  / `KindTalkerAlias` like Phase 1.
- **DMR voice decoding path and Enhanced Privacy key
  configuration** (issue #276, PR #298, #301, #304, #305). DMR
  previously decoded control channels only. The voice path now
  ships: a DMR voice superframe decoder plus AMBE+2
  forward-error-correction (`internal/radio/dmr/voice/` — 72-bit
  on-air frame → C0/C1 Golay(23,12) + C1 descramble → 49-bit
  vocoder payload, ported from mbelib / DSD), and a composer DMR
  voice chain that runs IQ → DMR receiver → superframe decoder →
  AMBE FEC and writes the FEC-decoded frames to the call's
  `.raw` sidecar. A dependency-free RC4 keystream generator
  (`internal/crypto/rc4/`) and per-system `encryption_keys`
  config (`key_id` + `algorithm: rc4` + hex `key`, validated at
  load) lay the foundation for known-key Enhanced Privacy voice
  decryption.
- **P25 Phase 1 CQPSK / LSM demodulator path** for simulcast P25
  sites (issue #275). New per-system YAML key
  `p25_phase1_demod_mode: cqpsk` routes the control-channel IQ
  through a complex RRC matched filter + Gardner timing recovery +
  differential QPSK quadrant decode with LSM dibit remap, replacing
  the FM-discriminator + 4-level slicer path that produces near-
  random dibits on Linear Simulcast Modulation. The C4FM path stays
  the default for conventional non-simulcast deployments. Pipeline
  construction now logs `ccdecoder: p25/phase1 pipeline configured
  demod=…` so operators can confirm which path is active.
- **P25 Phase 1 CQPSK blind equalizer for simulcast multipath**
  (issue #275, PR #306). A P25 simulcast site sums several
  synchronised transmitters into a multipath channel that closes
  the CQPSK constellation, so the Frame Sync Word never
  correlates and the control channel never locks. Because LSM is
  a linear modulation the distortion is linear in the complex
  symbols: the `equalizer.CMA` blind (Constant Modulus
  Algorithm) equalizer is now wired onto the CQPSK symbol stream
  between Gardner timing recovery and the differential decode.
  It needs no training sequence and is a near-noop on a clean
  constant-modulus signal. The #275 IQ-impairment harness gains
  a multipath channel model.
- **Coarse AFC on the P25 Phase 1 C4FM control channel** (issue
  #275, PR #303). A residual RTL-SDR carrier offset leaves the
  FM discriminator with a constant DC bias that shifts the C4FM
  4-level slicer's eye off its decision regions; at ≥500 Hz the
  Frame Sync Word stops correlating entirely. A new coarse-AFC
  stage (`demod.CoarseAFC`) between the matched filter and the
  symbol clock tracks the bias with a slow single-pole average
  and subtracts it, recentring the eye. On a clean signal the
  estimate converges to ~0 and the stage is a near-noop.
- **Multi-rotation FSW search** on the P25 Phase 1 sync detector.
  `SyncDetector.ProcessWithRotation` tries all four cyclic shifts
  of the dibit alphabet against the canonical FrameSyncWord and
  returns the rotation that matched, absorbing residual symbol-
  polarity / I-Q-swap ambiguity. The downstream control-channel
  parser inverts the rotation before NID BCH + TSBK trellis decode.
  Rotation=0 wins on ties so existing clean-fixture tests stay
  green.

### Fixed

- **Web console WebSocket reconnect storm and intermittent
  crash** (issue #290, PR #302). The event-stream client reset
  its reconnect backoff the instant a socket opened, so a
  connection that opened then dropped immediately
  reconnect-stormed at the floor delay forever; the backoff now
  resets only after a connection holds open for a stability
  window, and reconnect delays carry equal jitter. Socket
  teardown nulls every handler and gates status writes behind a
  `closed` flag, so a late event from an in-flight socket can no
  longer write to the store after teardown and trip a React
  render crash. The health-check and event-stream effects are
  keyed on the primitive server URL / token values instead of a
  derived object so they re-run only on a real server change.
- **Web console SPA render loop blanked the UI on connect**
  (issue #290, PR #295). `selectClientConfig` returned a fresh
  object on every call, so the WebSocket effect — which listed
  the derived config in its deps and synchronously wrote
  connection status to the store — re-fired without bound (React
  error #185), blanking the UI and churning the socket open /
  close. The selector is now memoised to a stable reference
  until the server URL / token actually change; the event
  WebSocket URL is rebuilt with the URL API (handles uppercase
  schemes, never emits a host-less URL); and a top-level
  `ErrorBoundary` shows a fallback instead of a blank page on a
  render crash.
- **P25 Phase 1 CQPSK control channel locked only in a narrow
  RTL-SDR gain window** (issue #275, PR #307). The CMA blind
  equalizer added for simulcast P25 made the CQPSK path
  gain-sensitive: the Gardner timing-error detector and the CMA
  weight update both use un-normalised, amplitude-dependent
  error terms, so the chain converged only when the signal sat
  in a narrow amplitude band. An AGC on the matched-filter
  output now normalises every capture to the level the Gardner
  and CMA loops are tuned for, restoring scale invariance
  regardless of front-end gain. `dsp.AGC` was reworked from a
  per-sample feedback loop — which spiked into gain runaway on a
  near-zero symbol of a linear-modulation stream — into a robust
  power-EMA feed-forward normaliser.
- **P25 Phase 1 symbol-clock loops miscounted symbols across
  IQ-chunk boundaries** (issue #275, PR #300, #311). Both
  symbol-timing-recovery loops rebuild their working buffer each
  call but mishandled the chunk seam, so the recovered dibit
  count depended on IQ chunk size — a live RTL-SDR delivers
  ~19-symbol USB transfers, and the drift scattered dibit errors
  so the Frame Sync Word never aligned and the control channel
  never locked. The Gardner loop (CQPSK / LSM path) re-emitted
  ~1 surplus symbol per call; the Mueller-Müller loop (C4FM
  path) dropped `src[0]` of every continuation chunk. Both now
  treat the carried-over samples as pure look-back context, so
  the recovered dibit stream is byte-identical regardless of
  chunk size.
- **P25 Phase 1 dibit-rotation inversion broke simulcast
  control-channel lock** (PR #296). The FSW sync detector
  reports rotation `k` such that `(received + k) mod 4` is
  canonical, so dibits are recovered by adding `k` — but
  `rotateDibits` added `(4-k) & 3`, correct only for even
  rotations. The odd quadrant slips (1, 3) that the CQPSK / LSM
  demod leaves on simulcast P25 recovered every dibit off by
  two, so the NID BCH decode failed and the control channel
  never locked.
- **Trunked control-channel decode on live RTL-SDR hardware**
  (issue #275). The ccdecoder fed every per-protocol receiver the
  full, un-channelized SDR IQ stream (commonly 2.048 MHz), so the
  matched filter + symbol-clock loop ran at ≈427 samples per symbol
  against a ±1 MHz swath and the Frame Sync Word never correlated —
  no protocol could lock on-air, regardless of gain, PPM, or demod
  mode. A digital down-converter now decimates each raw IQ chunk
  (rational polyphase resample) to the narrowband channel rate the
  per-protocol receivers are matched-filter-tuned for — ~48 kHz for
  the 4800-baud C4FM family, 144 kHz for TETRA — before the pipeline
  sees it. The IQ-power gauge still reports the raw SDR input level.
- **P25 Phase 1 control channel never locked on live SDR chunking**
  (issue #275). The control-channel state machine discarded every
  Frame Sync Word hit unless the whole 154-dibit frame (FSW + NID +
  TSBK) fell inside a single `Process` call. A live RTL-SDR delivers
  16 KiB USB transfers — only ~19 P25 symbols per call — so the NID
  never fit and the channel never locked, even with the IQ stream
  correctly channelized. `ControlChannel.Process` now accumulates
  dibits across calls and assembles frames that straddle IQ-chunk
  boundaries.
- **macOS device enumeration panicked before listing any
  RTL-SDR** (issue #257, PR #293). The macOS USB enumerator
  registered CoreFoundation function pointers whose signatures
  named a `[16]byte` array type; purego's `RegisterLibFunc`
  panics with "unsupported kind array" on any array in a
  registered signature, so IOKit failed to load for every macOS
  user before a single call ran and `sdr list` found no devices.
  The 16-byte `CFUUIDBytes` is now passed as two `uint64`
  register halves. Per-driver enumerate errors also surface from
  `EnumerateAll`, so `sdr list` prints the failure instead of a
  silent empty list.
- **Config rejected valid trunking protocols** (issue #291, PR
  #294). Config validation hardcoded a `p25|dmr|nxdn` whitelist
  that was never updated as the other protocols landed, so a
  valid `protocol: tetra` (or edacs / ltr / mpt1327 / …) system
  failed at load despite being fully implemented. Validation now
  routes through `trunking.ParseProtocol` — the same parser the
  daemon uses — so the canonical protocol list is the single
  source of truth.

## [v0.1.7] — 2026-05-19

Observability + import-pipeline release. Twelve merged PRs land the
first batch of per-system Prometheus metrics (issue #269), unblock
RadioReference imports for the post-layout-change PDF format plus
non-US (Australian MMR) systems and native RR CSV downloads (issue
\#271, #278, #279), and close two RTL-SDR silent-failure modes that
prevented P25 control-channel lock on plug-in: a missing
`SetSampleRate` on pool open (issue #275, PR #281) and a Windows
cold-boot warmup timeout that wasn't on the bring-up retry envelope
(PR #274). P25 phase-1 affiliation and unit-registration events now
flow through the SSE/WS telemetry stream (slice of issue #268, PR
\#285). New `gophertrunk_sdr_iq_power_dbfs` gauge + throttled
low-power log catch the gain-at-zero / antenna-disconnected case
operators previously had to guess at (issue #275 follow-ups, PR
\#282).

### Added

- **Prometheus metrics for per-system call rate, encryption breakdown,
  control-channel health, and SDR device tuning state** (issue #269,
  PR #272). New series:
  `gophertrunk_calls_started_total{system,protocol,encrypted}`,
  `gophertrunk_control_channel_frequency_hz{system}`,
  `gophertrunk_control_channel_transitions_total{system,event}`,
  `gophertrunk_sdr_gain_db{driver,serial,role}`,
  `gophertrunk_sdr_gain_auto{driver,serial,role}`,
  `gophertrunk_sdr_ppm{driver,serial,role}`,
  `gophertrunk_sdr_bias_tee{driver,serial,role}`. SDR tuning gauges
  come from a scrape-time snapshot collector so they always reflect
  live pool state.
- **`gophertrunk_sdr_iq_power_dbfs{system}` gauge** updated roughly
  once per second from the cc decoder with mean |IQ|² converted to
  dBFS (issue #275 follow-ups, PR #282). Idle is ~-45 dBFS, healthy
  signal ~-25 dBFS, > -3 means the ADC is clipping. The series is
  dropped on decoder teardown so stale dBFS doesn't outlive the
  active system. Paired with a throttled low-power debug log on the
  same path: < -55 dBFS prints `ccdecoder: iq power very low — check
  antenna, gain, USB` at most once per 5 s — catches the
  gain-at-zero / antenna-disconnected / USB-stuck cases without
  flooding the log.
- **P25 phase-1 affiliation and unit-registration telemetry events**
  (slice of issue #268, PR #285). The cc decoder previously
  recognised TSBK opcodes 0x28 (Group Affiliation Response) and 0x2C
  (Unit Registration Response) but silently dropped them at the
  `dispatchTSBK` default branch. Both opcodes now decode through new
  parsers in `internal/trunking`, publish via two new event kinds
  (`KindAffiliation`, `KindUnitRegistration`), and reach the
  `/api/v1/events` SSE/WS stream as JSON-tagged DTOs. Byte layouts
  follow OP25's `trunk_p25.py` reference. Two regression tests pin
  the JSON shape so downstream dashboards can rely on stable field
  names.
- **Native RadioReference CSV import** for `gophertrunk import-pdf`
  (issue #271, PR #273). RadioReference's `/db/sid/<sid>/download`
  CSV is a flat talkgroup list with no metadata — the importer
  auto-detects the format and the new `-name` / `-sysid` flags
  supply the missing fields (filename stem is used when `-name` is
  omitted). Native CSV carries no sites; combine with a `-pdf` (or
  bundle CSV) when you need control-channel frequencies.
- **`-extract-only` flag for `gophertrunk import-pdf`** (PR #273).
  Paired with a single `-pdf`, dumps the positioned-text rows
  extracted from the PDF as JSON to stdout and exits, so parser bug
  reports can ship a ready-to-replay fixture without sharing the
  original PDF.
- **Per-(VID, PID) bias-tee GPIO table** for the pure-Go RTL-SDR
  driver (issue #275 follow-ups, PR #282). The hardcoded `GPIO 0`
  constant in `device.go` moved to a `knownDevice.BiasTeeGPIO`
  field. Every current entry inherits `GPIO 0` (the dominant
  RTL-SDR.com v3+ / NESDR Smart v5 pinout), but the mechanism now
  exists for boards with a different pinout to be added without
  forking the driver.
- **Throttled "no sync hits" debug log on P25 phase-1 and phase-2
  process paths** (PR #281). A 2 s-throttled line fires when the
  sync detector finds zero hits in a chunk — surfaces the
  previously-silent "IQ isn't reaching the decoder" case operators
  couldn't tell apart from a wrong-frequency cc.
- **"The Story of GopherTrunk" page** on the Pages site
  (PR #280) — project origin and design philosophy, linked from
  the README intro and support page.
- **Discord and Reddit community callouts** on the Pages site
  (PR #286).

### Changed

- `gophertrunk_calls_total` now carries `{system,protocol,encrypted,reason}`
  labels (was `{reason}`); `gophertrunk_calls_active` is now a
  GaugeVec keyed by `{system,protocol}` (was a bare gauge).
  Dashboards that previously scraped the unlabeled shape can recover
  with
  `sum without(system,protocol,encrypted) (gophertrunk_calls_total)`.
- **SDR pool now programs the IQ sample rate at device open** (issue
  \#275, PR #281). `Pool.Open` takes the rate as its first argument
  and calls `SetSampleRate` on every device immediately after the
  USB open; `SetSampleRate` failure closes that device and drops it
  from the pool rather than letting a wrong-rate radio poison the
  decoder. The pure-Go RTL-SDR driver also programs 2.048 MS/s in
  `runBringup` as a belt-and-suspenders default for any future
  consumer of the driver.
- `docs/import.md` and `docs/user-guide-windows.md`: RadioReference
  moved the PDF export from the page footer to the top **Download**
  menu (PDF / CSV / DSD options at `/db/sid/<sid>/download`).
  Instructions updated.

### Fixed

- **RTL-SDR P25 control channel never locked on a freshly opened
  device** (issue #275, PR #281). The pool opened devices and
  applied PPM / gain / bias-tee but never called `SetSampleRate`,
  so the chip's resampler stayed at whatever divisor it powered up
  with while every decoder pipeline downstream did its
  matched-filter and symbol-clock math against `cfg.SDR.SampleRate`.
  Symptom on real hardware was a silent failure: symbol timing
  wrong, FSW / 20-dibit outbound sync detector never matched, and
  the only log line that fired was the cc-hunt retune. The pool now
  programs the rate at open time (see Changed above).
- **`gophertrunk sdr list --probe` fatal-erroring on Windows cold
  boot** (PR #274). The WinUSB warmup sysctl-write returned
  `ErrTimeout` (the Windows equivalent of the Linux EPIPE stall),
  but `isBringupResetable` only matched EPIPE / `ErrDeviceGone`, so
  the existing bring-up `USBDEVFS_RESET` + re-claim retry envelope
  skipped this path. `ErrTimeout` is now treated as resetable; the
  retry stays one-shot, so worst-case cost on a genuine
  (non-cold-boot) timeout is one wasted ~200 ms reset before the
  original error resurfaces. `tunerBringupHint` also grew a
  Windows-aware remediation pointing at the Zadig step for the case
  where the retry also times out.
- `gophertrunk import-pdf` no-System-Name error now prints the
  first ~30 extracted rows inline so the failure is self-diagnosing
  (issue #271, PR #273).
- `parseMetaLine` accepts case-insensitive and whitespace-variant
  labels (`SYSTEM NAME:`, `System Name :`, double-spaces). Falls
  back to the page-title banner ("`<System> Menu`") when no
  explicit `System Name:` line is present, so a minor RadioReference
  layout tweak no longer breaks extraction (issue #271, PR #273).
- `extractPDFRows` now auto-detects RadioReference's two PDF font
  encodings (issue #271, PR #277). Older RR PDFs ship raw glyph
  bytes that need a `+27` ASCII shift; newer ones (e.g. MMR.pdf,
  sid 7197) embed a proper font CMap and arrive already-decoded.
  The extractor sniffs the first 50 rows for anchor strings
  (`System Name`, `Sites and Frequencies`, `Talkgroups`, `WACN`,
  `Last Updated`) and applies the shift only when those anchors are
  absent. `decodeShift` also leaves literal `0x20` spaces alone —
  the new library release emits the occasional in-text literal
  space alongside the encoded `0x05` separator-space, and shifting
  it was corrupting output as `;`.
- The PDF parser now handles RadioReference's non-US layout (e.g.
  Australian MMR system) (issue #278, PR #283). New `siteRowDashRE`
  pattern matches dash-joined `RFSS-Site (X-Y) Name freqs` rows;
  `System Frequencies` and `System Talkgroups` are accepted as
  section markers; `Display` is recognised as an alias for the
  `Alpha Tag` column; `a`-suffix secondary-control-channel
  frequencies are now captured; talkgroup hex columns with leading
  zeros (e.g. `065` for dec=101) are validated numerically rather
  than by string match.
- The `gophertrunk import-pdf` TUI is now usable on systems with
  dozens of sites or hundreds of talkgroups (issue #279, PR #284).
  The Sites tab previously rendered every row unconditionally and
  spilled off-screen; both tabs now paginate to fit the terminal
  height (with a 20-row fallback when `tea.WindowSizeMsg` hasn't
  arrived yet), show a `Site N of M  (showing X-Y)` position
  indicator, and accept `pgup`/`pgdn` for page jumps plus
  `home`/`end` / `g`/`G` to jump to the first/last entry. The
  footer hints are updated.

## [v0.1.6] — 2026-05-18

RTL-SDR driver stabilization release. Eleven merged PRs land
librtlsdr-parity fixes for tuner init bursts, I²C bridge timing,
crystal-frequency selection, macOS IOKit enumeration, and a new
wire-level USB debug-trace switch — layered defenses against the
long-running issue #248 burst-EPIPE reproduction (PRs #255, #256,
#258, #259, #260, #261, #262, #263, #265, #266) plus the macOS
enumeration miss (issue #257, PR #261). Issues #248 and #257
remain open pending field validation on the reporter hardware.
No daemon-level behavior changes outside the RTL-SDR driver.

### Added

- **`RTLSDR_DEBUG_USB=1` environment variable for wire-level debug
  traces.** When set, every USB control transfer the RTL-SDR driver
  issues — `ControlIn`, `ControlOut`, `Reset` — is logged to stderr
  with the bmRequestType, wValue/wIndex/wLength, the payload hex
  (capped at 64 bytes per call), and the outcome (ok / err + duration).
  Output is diffable against `LIBUSB_DEBUG=4` traces from osmocom
  librtlsdr's `rtl_test`, so users can pinpoint exactly which
  transfer stalls on hardware that still misbehaves after the
  librtlsdr-parity fixes. Also emits a per-service trace from the
  macOS IOKit enumerator (matched IOKit class, locationID, VID/PID,
  dropped-property reason) when set — intended for diagnosing
  dongles that don't appear in `sdr list` output. Off by default;
  zero allocation when unset. Documented in the install-linux and
  install-macos troubleshooting tables.

### Changed

- **RTL-SDR tuner I²C bridge now toggles per public method instead of
  per register write.** Every tuner driver (R82xx, E4000, FC0012,
  FC0013, FC2580) previously turned the RTL2832U I²C repeater on
  before each `writeReg`/`readReg` and back off after it — three USB
  control transfers per single-byte chip register access. The
  repeater is now opened once at the top of each public method
  (`Init`, `Standby`, `SetFreq`, `SetBandwidth`, `SetGain`,
  `SetGainMode`) and closed at the end, matching librtlsdr's
  `rtlsdr_set_tuner_*` wrap pattern. For an R820T2 `SetFreq` call
  (~10–15 register writes) this drops 40–60 USB control transfers per
  retune to the steady-state two — measurably faster on USB 2.0 hubs
  and meaningfully less timing-fragile on marginal cabling. Compatible
  with the issue #248 fix: `R82xx.Init`'s leading
  `SetI2CRepeater(true)` is the fresh wire write the chip needs to
  arm the bridge before its multi-byte burst, and the cache state
  ends up `false` post-Detect (off-toggle defer) so the on-toggle
  is real rather than a cache no-op.
- **RTL-SDR tuner detection now follows librtlsdr's exact rtlsdr_open
  probe order and GPIO bring-up dance.** The Go port previously
  probed R820T → R828D → E4000 → FC0013 → FC0012 → FC2580 with no
  GPIO pulses, which silently broke detection of non-R820T tuners
  (FC2580/FC0013/E4000/FC0012) on dongles whose chip-enable lines
  hold the IC in reset until pulsed. The orchestrator now mirrors
  `librtlsdr.c` exactly: R820T → R828D → GPIO5 high→low reset →
  FC2580 → GPIO4 output enable → FC0013 → E4000 → FC0012 (followed by
  a GPIO6 reset pulse if FC0012 was found). FC0012's `Init` also no
  longer emits the two spurious `0x0C` register writes ("soft-reset")
  the pre-fix code shipped — librtlsdr never wrote those; the chip
  reset is the GPIO5 pulse.

### Fixed

- **RTL-SDR R828D-family tuners (RTL-SDR Blog V4 and similar) now
  use the correct 16 MHz reference crystal.** `NewR82xx`
  previously initialized every R820T/R820T2/R828D instance with
  `r.xtalHz = 28_800_000`, the R820T value. R828D variants run
  from a 16 MHz crystal per librtlsdr's `R828D_XTAL_FREQ`. The
  divergence didn't surface during init (the burst uses fixed
  register values), but every `SetFreq` call on an R828D would
  compute PLL parameters against the wrong reference — every
  tuned frequency landed at ~28.8/16 = 1.8× the requested LO,
  rendering V4 dongles unusable for tuning once they did open.
  `NewR82xx` now picks the per-chip default; `SetXtal` keeps
  working as the explicit override for boards with non-standard
  crystals. Closes [issue #264](https://github.com/MattCheramie/GopherTrunk/issues/264)'s
  tuning-after-init half; the init-burst EPIPE half is covered
  by the existing layered defense from issues #248 / PRs
  #258 / #260 / #262 / #263 / #265, which apply to R828D writes
  identically.

- **RTL-SDR R820T burst-init now adds a chip-settle window and
  chunk-size fallback for the EPIPE-on-first-burst case.** Sixth
  iteration on issue #248 after PR #263's per-chunk EPIPE retry +
  open-path USBDEVFS_RESET envelope still failed to close it on two
  NESDR SMArt v5 units. The post-#263 trace confirms the USB reset
  doesn't change the chip's response to the 17-byte burst,
  `Demod.InitBaseband` matches librtlsdr's `rtlsdr_init_baseband`
  byte-for-byte across all 20 register writes + the 20-byte FIR
  upload, the load-bearing `SetI2CRepeater(true)` toggle from PR #262
  is on the wire immediately before each burst attempt, and EP0
  stays healthy post-EPIPE (subsequent control transfers succeed
  without `USBDEVFS_CLEAR_HALT`). Two new defenses ship in this
  round, layered before the existing inner+outer retry from PR #263:
  - `R82xx.Init` now sleeps 5 ms between opening the I²C repeater
    and emitting the burst, covering a chip-settle window librtlsdr
    gets incidentally via function-call latency that our tight
    PrepareDemod → Init back-to-back path doesn't.
  - `writeBurstRaw` now halves the chunk size on
    EPIPE-after-inner-retry-exhausted (16 → 8 → 4 floor) and re-runs
    the whole burst at the smaller size before giving up. Probes the
    chip's effective I²C-bridge FIFO depth empirically — librtlsdr's
    `NMAX_WRITES = 16` may exceed what specific firmware revisions
    accept. The final-failure error wraps as
    `tried chunk sizes 16,8,4; all EPIPE'd: ...` so reporters see
    attribution. Idempotent-write contract called out at the
    function comment — register writes through this path must stay
    safe to replay across the halving walk.
  If this still reproduces, kernel-level usbmon packet traces become
  the prerequisite — `LIBUSB_DEBUG=4` doesn't dump payloads and the
  diagnostic data inferrable from existing traces is exhausted.
  Continues [issue #248](https://github.com/MattCheramie/GopherTrunk/issues/248).

- **RTL-SDR R820T burst-init EPIPE now recovers via a single in-place
  retry + one-shot open-path reset hammer.** Two NESDR SMArt v5 units
  reproduced an EPIPE on the very first `r82xx_init_array` I²C-bridge
  OUT even after PR #262's load-bearing `SetI2CRepeater(true)` wire
  toggle was confirmed firing on the wire (per the post-#262 paired
  `RTLSDR_DEBUG_USB=1` / `LIBUSB_DEBUG=4` capture). The wire bytes
  are byte-identical to librtlsdr's `r82xx_write` first chunk, EP0 is
  not halted (subsequent control transfers succeed without
  `USBDEVFS_CLEAR_HALT`), and `rtl_test` never calls
  `libusb_reset_device` — the EPIPE is a request-specific NACK inside
  the chip, not a USB endpoint state issue.
  `R82xx.writeBurstChunk` now retries a failing chunk once after an
  8 ms settle (no extra repeater toggles — PR #262's contract intact;
  retry attribution is wrapped into the error as
  `after 1 retry on EPIPE: ...` so traces show whether it fired).
  `openDevice` now wraps the entire bring-up sequence (USB warmup →
  baseband init → tuner detect → demod prep → tuner.Init → IF freq)
  in a 1-shot reset+retry envelope on EPIPE / `ErrDeviceGone` —
  subsumes the previous warmup-only retry from PR #255 and extends
  it past the warmup phase. Non-EPIPE errors return immediately
  (reset is the wrong hammer for them). At most one USBDEVFS_RESET
  per `Open` call. `docs/install-linux.md` gains a usbmon
  packet-capture recipe for the next round of diagnostics if this
  doesn't close it — `LIBUSB_DEBUG=4` doesn't dump control-transfer
  payloads, usbmon does. Continues
  [issue #248](https://github.com/MattCheramie/GopherTrunk/issues/248).
- **RTL-SDR `tuners.Detect` again toggles the I²C repeater off on
  return.** An earlier change in this cycle had Detect leave the
  repeater ON across the tuner bring-up window under the theory
  that the wire toggle was a wasteful divergence from librtlsdr.
  Empirically on NESDR v5 silicon the toggle is load-bearing —
  even though the demod register already holds the on-value, the
  chip needs the fresh write to arm the I²C bridge for the next
  multi-byte burst. `R82xx.writeBurstRaw`'s leading
  `SetI2CRepeater(true)` is now a real wire write again (cache=false
  on entry post-Detect), matching librtlsdr's `rtlsdr_open` flow.
  The `PrepareDemod` sequence shipped earlier this cycle is
  unchanged — it remains independently correct librtlsdr-parity
  work that runs after Detect's off-toggle and before the tuner
  burst. Re-closes
  [issue #248](https://github.com/MattCheramie/GopherTrunk/issues/248)
  after the user retest showed the EPIPE persisting.

- **RTL-SDR enumeration on macOS now matches both legacy
  `IOUSBDevice` and modern `IOUSBHostDevice` IOKit classes.** The
  macOS USB enumerator previously matched only `IOUSBDevice`, which
  yields zero services on some Apple Silicon + macOS combinations
  where Apple's IOUSBFamily compatibility bridge is a no-op.
  `gophertrunk sdr list` returned an empty slice with no error and
  no diagnostic — dongles that worked fine in SDRTrunk, GQRX, and
  Homebrew `lsusb` were invisible to GopherTrunk. Both IOKit
  classes are now matched and their results unioned (deduplicated
  by IOKit `locationID`) in both `List` and `Open`. Closes
  [issue #257](https://github.com/MattCheramie/GopherTrunk/issues/257).

- **RTL-SDR open path now matches librtlsdr's R820T/R828D demod-prep
  sequence between `detect_tuner` and `tuner->init`.** The previous
  flow ran `tuners.Detect` (which toggled the I²C repeater off on
  return), then `tuner.Init`, then a generic `SetIFFreq` — skipping
  four demod-register writes librtlsdr emits before tuner init:
  disable Zero-IF mode (page 1, addr 0xB1, val 0x1A), enable
  In-phase ADC input only (page 0, addr 0x08, val 0x4D),
  `set_if_freq(3.57 MHz)`, and enable spectrum inversion (page 1,
  addr 0x15, val 0x01). Without those four writes the R820T-family
  chip is brought up against a Zero-IF / IQ datapath / inversion
  configuration that diverges from what librtlsdr ships, which has
  been the residual divergence after the chunking fix shipped in
  this cycle. New `R82xx.PrepareDemod` runs the sequence; `openDevice`
  invokes it on the R820T-family branch.
- **RTL-SDR `tuners.Detect` now leaves the I²C repeater on across the
  tuner bring-up window.** Previously Detect deferred
  `SetI2CRepeater(false)` and tuner.Init then re-enabled the repeater
  per burst, producing an off→on toggle between Detect and the very
  first I²C OUT — the wire byte right before the multi-byte burst
  that some NESDR v5 dongles stall on. Detect now leaves the
  repeater on on success (or toggles it off on the no-tuner
  error path); the new `openDevice` step list owns the post-Init
  off toggle.
- **RTL-SDR R820T/R820T2 manual gain now uses librtlsdr's balanced
  LNA+Mixer split.** `R82xx.SetGain` previously walked the LNA gain
  ladder to maximum-not-exceeding-target, then walked the mixer
  ladder — landing on the same numeric gain as librtlsdr but with all
  the gain concentrated on the LNA. The result was a worse noise
  figure and worse front-end linearity at every ladder entry. The
  walk now alternates LNA and mixer with pre-increment, matching
  `r82xx_set_gain` in osmocom librtlsdr. Affects every R820T/R820T2
  dongle (the common case) the moment the user picks a manual gain.
- **RTL-SDR E4000 (Elonics) tuner frequency setting now writes the
  correct synthesizer registers.** `E4000.SetFreq` was writing the
  fractional `X` value to `SYNTH5`/`SYNTH6` (off-by-one register) and
  never writing the band-select / R-divider byte to `SYNTH7` at all,
  so the chip would mistune at every frequency. The PLL math itself
  was correct; only the wire-level register addresses were wrong.
  Now matches librtlsdr's `e4k_tune_params` exactly. Affects E4000
  dongles (legacy hardware — NOXON DAB sticks and similar).
- **RTL-SDR R820T/R820T2 init burst now chunks at 16 bytes to match
  librtlsdr.** The 27-byte register flood at the top of `R82xx.Init`
  previously went on the wire as a single 28-byte I²C-bridge OUT
  (1 register pointer + 27 data bytes). Some NESDR v5 dongles stall
  the very first multi-byte OUT when its data payload exceeds 16
  bytes — librtlsdr's `r82xx_write` has chunked at `NMAX_WRITES = 16`
  for exactly this reason. `writeBurstRaw` now splits the data into
  ≤16-byte segments under one repeater on/off pair, advancing the
  register pointer per chunk (the chip auto-increments). The wire
  bytes are otherwise unchanged.
  Follow-up to the warmup probe shipped earlier in this cycle;
  addresses the residual reproduction in
  [issue #248](https://github.com/MattCheramie/GopherTrunk/issues/248).
- **RTL-SDR tuner init no longer fails on dongles left in a
  half-initialised USB state.** Open now performs librtlsdr's
  dummy-write probe (`USB_SYSCTL = 0x09`) immediately after claiming
  the interface and, on `EPIPE` / `ErrDeviceGone`, runs a one-shot
  `USBDEVFS_RESET` + re-claim before retrying. Dongles whose endpoint
  was left stalled by a crashed prior session or a freshly-unbound
  DVB kernel driver now open transparently instead of surfacing the
  EPIPE as "r82xx init: burst write: I2CWrite addr=0x34: broken pipe".
  When both attempts fail the existing tuner-bringup hint is still
  appended.
  Addresses [issue #248](https://github.com/MattCheramie/GopherTrunk/issues/248).

## [v0.1.5] — 2026-05-16

### Added

- **Remediation hint on tuner-init I²C failures.** The RTL-SDR
  driver now appends a one-line hint pointing at the three known
  root causes (DVB kernel driver still bound, marginal USB power,
  flaky cable / USB 3.0 hub) when the tuner doesn't ack on the I²C
  bus during bring-up — both the EPIPE-on-first-burst case and the
  mid-init `ErrDeviceGone` case. `docs/install-linux.md`'s
  troubleshooting table grows a matching row keyed on the literal
  error string so operators searching for "broken pipe" land
  somewhere actionable.
  Shipped in [PR #251](https://github.com/MattCheramie/GopherTrunk/pull/251),
  addressing [issue #248](https://github.com/MattCheramie/GopherTrunk/issues/248).
- **Bundled Zadig WinUSB driver installer in the Windows installer.**
  The Windows `setup.exe` now ships `zadig.exe` alongside
  `gophertrunk.exe`, so first-run operators no longer have to chase a
  separate download to bind the RTL-SDR's WinUSB driver. Setup adds a
  Start Menu shortcut **"Install RTL-SDR driver (Zadig)"** and offers
  an unchecked **"Run Zadig now"** option on the final wizard page;
  Zadig's own manifest handles the UAC elevation. The uninstaller
  also now strips the `{app}` entry from the system PATH (previously
  leaked across uninstalls) and asks whether to wipe the editable
  `config.yaml` + the Setup-created `gophertrunk-web` subfolder —
  default **No**, so user data is preserved unless explicitly opted
  in. Bundled binary is `zadig-2.9.exe` from libwdi `v1.5.1`
  (GPL-3.0); see [`THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`](THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md)
  for attribution.
  Shipped in [PR #249](https://github.com/MattCheramie/GopherTrunk/pull/249).
- **NXDN deviation surfaces on the TUI Settings → FEC tab.**
  The `nxdn_deviation_hz` knob shipped in [PR #243](https://github.com/MattCheramie/GopherTrunk/pull/243)
  but wasn't visible from the operator console. The
  per-system FEC summary now appends `deviation: 1800 Hz`
  (or whatever override is configured) alongside the existing
  `viterbi:` mode, matching the pattern P25 Phase 2 / MPT 1327
  use for their per-protocol opt-outs. The hash gate that
  controls FEC table refresh covers the new field so a
  config-reloaded override surfaces inside one SSE round-trip.
- **NXDN real-air integration harness skeleton.**
  [`cmd/gophertrunk/integration_cc_nxdn_realair_test.go`](cmd/gophertrunk/integration_cc_nxdn_realair_test.go)
  is the skip-gated companion to the existing synthesized
  `TestDaemonCCDecodesNXDN`. When a contributor drops a single
  `*.cfile` + sibling `*.metadata.json` pair into
  [`samples/nxdn/`](samples/nxdn/), the harness:
   - registers the in-tree `sdr.MockFloat32Driver` against the
     capture,
   - tunes the daemon to `metadata.center_freq_hz` at
     `metadata.sample_rate_hz` (both required at the top level
     since GNU Radio cfiles don't embed them),
   - boots the daemon with `nxdn_viterbi_mode: spec`,
   - waits up to 3 s wall time for `events.KindCCLocked`,
   - asserts `LockState.SystemID` / `SiteID` / `FrequencyHz`
     match the documented `metadata.expected` values
     byte-for-byte.
  
  CI stays green via a documented `t.Skipf` fall-through until
  a capture lands. Multiple `*.cfile` candidates surface as an
  explicit test error so the contributor knows to disambiguate.
  Metadata schema documented in
  [`samples/nxdn/README.md`](samples/nxdn/README.md).

- **Per-system NXDN deviation tunability** (`nxdn_deviation_hz`).
  The NXDN receiver's 4-FSK slicer was hardcoded to the Common Air
  Interface spec value of 1800 Hz peak deviation, which produces a
  bimodal dibit distribution on captures from transmitters that
  deviate from spec (e.g. `samples/nxdn/NXDN96 IQ.wav` reports
  3 / 50 / 3 / 44 % through the production pipeline). Operators can
  now set `nxdn_deviation_hz: 2400` (or any positive value) on a
  per-system basis to recalibrate the slicer against the captured
  signal's actual deviation. Zero / unset keeps the spec default.
  See [`samples/nxdn/README.md`](samples/nxdn/README.md#tuning-deviation-for-non-spec-captures)
  for the sweep recipe.
- **AMBE+2 knox preset bundles** (`ambe2.RegisterPreset` /
  `ambe2.ListPresets`). The existing `SetKnoxTone` hook (b₁ ∈
  [144, 163]) registers one vendor-specific dual-tone pair at a
  time; the new preset API takes a named bundle of entries and
  records the preset name for operator diagnostics. Lets per-vendor
  sub-packages ship curated tables via a single `RegisterPreset`
  call instead of repeated `SetKnoxTone`s. The in-tree code ships
  no vendor presets because the public AMBE+2 spec does not
  document the [144, 163] frequency range — see
  [`docs/vocoders.md`](docs/vocoders.md#sourcing-vendor-frequencies)
  for the sourcing checklist.

### Internal

- **Polish pass: config example completeness, YSF acceptance criteria,
  tuner math coverage.**
  - `config.example.yaml` now shows commented examples for every
    per-system FEC opt-out documented in the README's
    [§FEC opt-outs](https://github.com/MattCheramie/GopherTrunk#fec-opt-outs)
    table. NXDN (`nxdn_viterbi_mode`, `nxdn_deviation_hz`), P25
    Phase 2 (`p25_phase2_{trellis,rs,scrambler,clock}_mode`),
    TETRA (`tetra_colour_code`, `tetra_channel`,
    `tetra_channel_coding`, `tetra_clock_mode`), EDACS
    (`edacs_bch_mode`), MPT 1327 (`mpt1327_bch_mode`,
    `mpt1327_cwsc_tolerance`), and D-STAR (`dstar_fec_mode`)
    previously had docs but no example block to copy from.
  - `samples/ysf/README.md` grows the explicit
    `## Acceptance criteria` section the other four sample
    READMEs (`nxdn`, `dmr-tier2`, `mpt1327`, `tetra`) already
    have. Three numbered criteria — CRC pass-through against the
    metadata's `fich_sequence`, MMDVMHost-vs-DSDcc schedule
    locked, and trellis correction-depth bounded ≤ 4 errors per
    100-bit on-air block at SNR ≥ 12 dB.
  - `internal/sdr/rtlsdr/tuners` coverage rises from 30.3% to
    43.5% via ten new tests covering: E4000 PLL Σ-Δ synth math
    (hand-computed Z / X for 50 MHz / 100 MHz / 433 MHz / 868 MHz
    / 1.5 GHz against the band-table walk in `e4k.go:84-97`),
    `ErrUnsupportedFreq` exact-boundary inclusivity for E4000 /
    FC0012 / FC0013 / FC2580 (the production `< minHz || > maxHz`
    guard accepts the endpoints), `nearestGainIndex` rounding
    behaviour on E4000's 17-step LNA ladder + the shared helper's
    clamp / tie-break invariants, and `fc0012NearestGainIndex`
    rounding parity. No production-code changes — pure post-hoc
    coverage of math paths that don't need RTL-SDR hardware.

- **DVSI mock-transport error-path coverage.** The
  `internal/voice/dvsi` test suite previously exercised the happy
  paths (scripted exchange, loopback silence, ErrNoDevice fall-
  through) but left the error-wrapping branches uncovered.
  Fifteen new tests now lock in: `Open(DefaultOptions())` returns
  `ErrNoDevice` carrying VID/PID/serial diagnostics, zero-valued
  VID/PID falls back to the documented FT2232H defaults, explicit
  `Transport` beats `LoopbackOnly` in `Open`'s switch, `Decode`
  wraps `transport.Write` / `transport.Read` errors with their
  origin labels, the loopback `Transport` rejects `Read` before
  `Write` + `Write`/`Read` after `Close` + malformed packets,
  and `PktControl` / unknown-type packets get cleanly Ack-mirrored
  so a future fuzz target won't stall on them. Hardware
  integration unchanged — `openUSBTransport` still returns
  `ErrNoDevice` until a chip is available for round-trip
  testing.

- **Calibrate harness math is testable without external fixtures.**
  Extracted `calibrate.CompareSamples([]int16, []int16) Result` so
  the RMS-ratio + cross-correlation math can be exercised on
  synthetic streams. The two existing skip-gated tests
  (`TestCompareIMBE*`, `TestCompareAMBE2*`) keep waiting for
  captured DSD-FME / OP25 reference WAVs; the new
  `TestCompareSamplesSyntheticGainOffset` validates the math
  unconditionally (a +3 dB louder reference must produce
  `RMSRatioDb = −3.0 ± 0.5` and `PeakXcorr ≥ 0.99`). Regressions
  in the loudness / similarity math now fail CI without needing
  any external reference data to land first.

- **Cleanup & coverage round.**
  - `web/scripts/seal-node-modules.mjs` is registered as the npm
    `postinstall` hook. It drops a sentinel `web/node_modules/go.mod`
    so Go's recursive package discovery (`go list ./...`,
    `go test ./...`) skips the stray Go packages npm dependencies
    occasionally ship inside their tarballs (e.g.
    `flatted/golang/pkg/flatted`). No more spurious entries in Go
    package listings on developer machines that have run
    `npm install`.
  - `cmd/gophertrunk/launcher.go` grows three injectable seams
    (`hasWebAssetsFn`, `canOpenBrowserFn`, `openBrowserFn`) so
    `openWebUI` can be exercised end-to-end without spawning a real
    browser. New tests verify the embedded-SPA branch wins when
    `gtweb.HasAssets()` returns true, the headless-fallback prints
    instead of launching, the no-embed sibling-discovery path runs
    cleanly, and the missing-HTTP-addr error fires.
  - `watchReloadSignal` now installs `signal.Notify` synchronously
    before spawning its goroutine — fixes a latent race where
    SIGHUP delivered immediately after the call could kill the
    process (default SIGHUP action) before the goroutine got
    around to registering its handler. Visible only in tightly-
    timed tests; harmless in production where SIGHUP arrives long
    after startup.
  - New `TestSIGHUP_TriggersReload` and
    `TestSIGHUP_BadConfigDoesNotCrash` send real SIGHUP signals to
    the test process and assert the watcher's reload path runs and
    that malformed-YAML reloads leave the in-memory config intact.

- **Test infrastructure: web SPA + in-process TUI.**
  - SPA gains Vitest + React Testing Library. `Import.test.tsx`
    covers the no-config / no-mutations banners + the
    Stage→Preview→Result happy path + commit / discard / error
    flows; `Settings.test.tsx` covers the inline-edit state
    machine, client-side validation, server PATCH errors, and
    restart-required badges. Run with `npm test`.
  - The in-process TUI launcher path (`runInProcessTUI`) is split
    into a testable `prepareInProcessTUI` (URL resolve, log
    redirect, model construction) and a thin `prog.Run()` wrapper.
    New tests cover missing-HTTP-addr error, log-redirect
    correctness, cleanup restoring the original writer, the
    constructed client actually reaching the daemon, plus a
    teatest-driven smoke test of the bubbletea Update loop against
    a stub HTTP daemon.
  - `internal/api.Server` now exposes `BoundAddr()`, and
    `Daemon.HTTPListenAddr()` prefers the actually-bound address
    when the listener has resolved an ephemeral `:0` port. Fixes
    a long-standing bug in the `HTTPListenAddr` docstring claim
    "helpful for tests using an ephemeral `:0` port" — it really
    is now.

### Added

- **Interactive daemon launcher.** `gophertrunk` (no args) now prompts
  the operator on a TTY for what to drive: `[1]` in-process TUI, `[2]`
  bundled web SPA in the system browser, or `[3]` stay headless.
  Non-TTY stdin (systemd, Windows service, Docker) auto-selects
  headless so service managers see no behaviour change. New flags
  preselect: `-tui`, `-web`, `-headless`; the three are mutually
  exclusive. See [`docs/launcher.md`](docs/launcher.md).
- **Live settings editing.** New `PATCH /api/v1/settings` endpoint
  accepts a sparse patch (every field optional), writes the result to
  `config.yaml` preserving comments + formatting, and hot-reloads the
  fields the daemon knows how to change in-process (audio volume /
  mute / recording, scanner scan mode, log level). Other fields
  ("restart required") are written to disk and flagged in the
  response so the SPA / TUI can render badges. An mtime guard refuses
  to clobber a config.yaml that was edited externally while the
  daemon was running.
- **Live import.** New `POST /api/v1/import` (multipart),
  `POST /api/v1/import/{id}/commit`, `DELETE /api/v1/import/{id}`
  endpoints let operators upload RadioReference PDFs / multi-section
  CSVs to a running daemon, preview the parsed systems, and commit
  into `config.yaml` without restarting. The TUI grows an Import
  panel (Stage → Preview → Result); the web SPA grows a matching
  `/import` route with a native file picker.
- **Startup hardening.** A new pre-flight step auto-creates the
  recordings / storage / cc-cache parent dirs and verifies TLS
  cert/key parse cleanly before the daemon binds. SDR-pool open
  failures and missing talkgroup CSVs collect into `startup_warnings`
  (surfaced on the runtime DTO + the launcher menu) instead of
  vanishing into the log. HTTP and gRPC bind failures now abort the
  daemon cleanly instead of being demoted to warnings — the launcher
  never lands against a half-dead daemon.
- **Embedded web SPA.** The daemon binary now embeds the built SPA
  (when `make web-build` was run before `go build`) and serves it
  at `/` on the HTTP API. `gophertrunk -web` opens the daemon URL
  directly; client-side routes (`/scanner`, `/settings`, `/import`,
  …) fall back to `index.html` so React-Router takes over. Fresh
  checkouts without a `web/dist/` build keep the existing sibling-
  directory discovery path. See [`docs/web.md`](docs/web.md).
- **Inline-editable Settings.** Every editable runtime knob the
  daemon hot-reloads (audio volume / mute, log level, scanner scan
  mode, …) plus the restart-required ones are now editable from
  both the TUI Settings panel (cursor + Enter to edit, Enter to
  save, Esc to cancel) and the web SPA's `/settings` route. Rows
  show a `[restart]` badge when the daemon can't hot-apply.
- **SIGHUP config reload.** Sending `SIGHUP` to a running daemon
  reloads `config.yaml`, diff-applies hot-reloadable fields, and
  logs a list of restart-required changes. The signal handler is a
  no-op on Windows.
- **Single-instance lock.** The daemon now flocks
  `<configdir>/.gophertrunk.lock` at startup so two instances aimed
  at the same `config.yaml` can't both try to claim the same
  RTL-SDR devices. The contender exits with a clear "another
  gophertrunk is running (pid=…, started=…)" message instead of an
  opaque libusb error.
- **Friendlier YAML errors.** `config: <path>: parse error …` now
  carries the resolved config path and a hint to run the wizard or
  recheck indentation.
- **Patent-posture notice plumbed through `startup_warnings`.**
  The AMBE+2 advisory no longer scrolls past on the daemon log
  immediately before the launcher prompt; it lands in the warnings
  channel and surfaces on the launcher menu / TUI dashboard / runtime
  DTO. `GOPHERTRUNK_QUIET_BANNER=1` still suppresses it for CI.

### Changed

- **Security defaults flipped for closed-LAN deployments.** Empty
  `api.auth.mode` now defaults to `disabled` (was `auto`) and empty
  `api.cors.allowed_origins` now permits any origin (was strict). The
  daemon still warns loudly at startup when these defaults take
  effect on a non-loopback bind, but the common single-host setup no
  longer needs explicit auth + CORS config to talk to the web SPA
  from `file://`. Operators on hostile networks opt back in via
  explicit `api.auth.mode: required` + `api.cors.allowed_origins:
  ["http://laptop.local:5173"]`. The default `api.http_addr` is now
  `127.0.0.1:8080` (was empty) so the bundled launcher's TUI / web
  paths work out of the box.

- **Config auto-discovery.** `gophertrunk run` (no `-config` flag)
  now walks `$GOPHERTRUNK_CONFIG` → `<UserConfigDir>/GopherTrunk/config.yaml`
  → `<Home>/Documents/GopherTrunk/config.yaml` → `./config.yaml`
  and loads the first match, printing `config: loaded <path>` on
  startup. When the chosen directory holds 2+ `*.yaml`/`*.yml`
  files, an interactive numbered picker prompts the operator on
  stdin (non-TTY launches like Windows services / systemd / CI
  auto-select the first match with a stderr warning instead of
  hanging). `internal/config.Discover()` + `DiscoverWith(opts)` for
  programmatic callers.
- **Windows installer "editable-files folder" page.** The Inno
  Setup wizard now asks where the operator's `config.yaml` should
  live (default `Documents\GopherTrunk`), seeds a starter file
  there (preserved across re-install + uninstall), pins
  `HKCU\Environment\GOPHERTRUNK_CONFIG` so the daemon finds it
  without `-config`, and adds a Start Menu shortcut "Edit my
  config.yaml (Notepad)". See [`install-windows.md`](docs/install-windows.md).
- **`gophertrunk sdr list --probe`** opens each enumerated device
  long enough to run the demod + tuner bring-up, populating the
  TUNER + gains columns. Without the flag those columns stay
  blank (Enumerate only reads USB descriptors, so the command is
  fast and never collides with a running daemon).
- **Config-builder wizard quality-of-life.** `←` / `→` toggles
  boolean fields (the footer hint already promised this). The
  path field expands `%VAR%` (Windows), `$VAR` / `${VAR}` (POSIX),
  and leading `~` at write time; the review screen shows
  "resolves to: \<abs\>" when expansion changes the path. The
  default write target now consults `$GOPHERTRUNK_CONFIG` and
  falls back to `<UserConfigDir>/GopherTrunk/config.yaml` when
  the current directory isn't writable (fixes "Access is denied"
  when the binary is launched from `C:\Program Files\GopherTrunk\`).
  `MkdirAll` errors on commit are surfaced instead of swallowed.
- `gophertrunk import-pdf` subcommand parses trunking-system data
  from RadioReference.com PDF exports **and** from structured
  multi-section CSV bundles, merging both into the operator's
  `config.yaml` plus per-system Trunk-Recorder-style talkgroup CSVs.
  Launches a Bubbletea TUI by default for reviewing/pruning sites and
  toggling per-talkgroup Scan/Lockout/Priority before write;
  `-no-tui`/`-dry-run`/`-force` flags cover scripting and CI bring-up.
  PDF and CSV sources are mixable in a single invocation (`-pdf` and
  `-csv` are both repeatable). Atomic writes (in-memory schema
  validation + temp file + rename) so a malformed source never
  corrupts the existing config. Supports P25 Phase 1 + Phase 2 PDFs;
  CSV bundles cover P25/DMR/NXDN. See
  [`docs/import.md`](docs/import.md) for the full operator reference
  and CSV format spec.
- Capture-spec **acceptance criteria** for every real-air-blocked
  follow-up at [`samples/<proto>/README.md`](samples/): TETRA
  wants 5 s lock latency + ≥ 90% frame recovery + a new
  `gophertrunk_tetra_viterbi_corrections` Prometheus histogram
  (gated by `metrics.detailed_fec: true`, not yet wired); NXDN
  wants ≥ 80% CRC-verified CAC bursts + SystemID match + 3 s
  lock; DMR Tier II wants byte-for-byte FLC match + clean
  Terminator-with-LC handling; MPT 1327 wants ≥ 95% true-positive
  lock rate + monotone tolerance sweep. [`samples/README.md`](samples/README.md)'s
  top-level table now shows status (✅ closed vs ⏳ capture
  pending) plus per-protocol "what captures buy" — DMR Tier II
  and MPT 1327 captures are optional secondary validation rather
  than the blocker (closed algorithmically in PR-A / PR-C).
- `internal/version` now exposes `Version`, `Commit`, and
  `BuildTime` (all `-ldflags`-injectable) plus a `String()`
  formatter (`"vX.Y.Z (sha=…, built=…)"`). Makefile and the
  release workflow both populate all three. `gophertrunk version`
  CLI subcommand prints the formatted string; the daemon logs it
  on startup.
- AMBE+2 patent-posture banner: daemon logs a one-line notice at
  startup pointing operators at
  [`docs/vocoders.md`](docs/vocoders.md). Suppressible via
  `GOPHERTRUNK_QUIET_BANNER=1` for CI / test harnesses.
- `make release-dry-run VERSION=v0.99.0` rehearses the release
  build locally — produces a `dist/dry-run/gophertrunk` with the
  supplied version metadata injected and a `SHA256SUMS` file.
  See [`CONTRIBUTING.md` §"Cutting a release"](CONTRIBUTING.md#cutting-a-release).
- Toolchain pinned to Go 1.25.10 (closes 23 stdlib CVEs in the
  default 1.25.0 toolchain auto-downloaded by `go 1.25.0` in
  go.mod).
- CI hardening: `vulncheck` job runs `govulncheck` against the
  direct + transitive dependency graph; `licenses` job regenerates
  the transitive-deps inventory via `google/go-licenses` and
  diffs against the committed `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.csv`;
  `integration` job runs `make test-integration` across the whole
  module to backstop the existing `cmd/gophertrunk/`-only target.
- `Makefile` targets: `make vulncheck`, `make licenses`,
  `make test-integration`.
- [`THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`](THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md) — hand-
  curated direct-deps license table sourced from `go.mod` plus the
  ISC attribution for the mbelib-derived AMBE+2 / IMBE codebook
  tables.
- `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and a systemd unit template
  ([`docs/gophertrunk.service`](docs/gophertrunk.service)) for
  operators standing the daemon up on Linux servers.
- Optional TLS on both the HTTP API and the gRPC server via
  `api.tls_cert` / `api.tls_key` in `config.yaml`. Plain TCP
  stays the default for loopback / trusted-LAN deployments. See
  [`docs/hardening.md` §"Transport encryption (TLS)"](docs/hardening.md#transport-encryption-tls).
- Extended `GET /api/v1/health` diagnostics:
  `pool_attached_count`, `active_calls`, `db_connected`,
  `metrics_enabled`, `auth_mode`, `version` alongside the legacy
  `status` + `now`. Supports k8s / Nomad readiness probes that
  distinguish "process up" from "actually working".
- HTTP server now sets `ReadTimeout` (30 s), `WriteTimeout`
  (30 s), and `IdleTimeout` (120 s) on top of the existing
  `ReadHeaderTimeout`. Streaming endpoints (SSE, audio stream)
  opt out per-request via
  `http.ResponseController.SetWriteDeadline(time.Time{})`.
- gRPC server now configures `keepalive.ServerParameters`
  (30 s idle ping, 10 s ack timeout) +
  `KeepaliveEnforcementPolicy` (5 s min-time floor,
  `PermitWithoutStream: true`) so long-lived `StreamAudio`
  subscribers detect dead peers cleanly.
- Graceful shutdown drain window for the HTTP server bumped from
  5 s to 30 s so in-flight SSE / WebSocket / audio subscribers
  drain instead of being torn down mid-frame.
- AMBE+2 knox / call-alert dual-tone vendor-override hook:
  [`ambe2.SetKnoxTone`](internal/voice/ambe2/knox.go). Operators
  with a per-vendor reference register
  `(freqA, freqB)` pairs for `b1 ∈ [144, 163]` and the matching
  tone frames synthesise through the same DTMF dual-tone path
  (phase-continuous + AGC-scaled).
- Voice calibration plumbing:
  [`cmd/voice-calibrate`](cmd/voice-calibrate/) CLI wrapping
  `calibrate.Compare`, per-vocoder testdata READMEs, and an
  end-to-end recipe at
  [`docs/voice-calibration.md`](docs/voice-calibration.md).
- DVSI USB-3000 / AMBE-3003 hardware backend scaffolding behind
  `-tags dvsi`. AMBE-3003 wire protocol + `Vocoder` + `Transport`
  interface + `voice.Vocoder` conformance + `init()`
  registration all ship; the USB / FTDI plumbing remains a stub
  returning `ErrNoDevice` (hardware integration follows when a
  chip is available for round-trip testing). Loopback `Transport`
  exercises the wire protocol + Vocoder state machine in CI.
- YSF FICH on-air codec: `EncodeFICHOnAir` / `DecodeFICHOnAir`
  in [`internal/radio/ysf/fich_trellis.go`](internal/radio/ysf/fich_trellis.go)
  per the MMDVMHost / DSDcc / Pi-Star reference (puncture
  positions `{0, 1, 102, 103}` + column-major 10×10 interleave).
  Exhaustive single-bit-flip recovery test confirms every one of
  the 100 on-air positions is Viterbi-corrected.
- DMR Tier II / Tier III symbol-density diagnostic test pair in
  [`cmd/gophertrunk/dmr_tier2_diagnostic_test.go`](cmd/gophertrunk/dmr_tier2_diagnostic_test.go)
  that localises the divergent statistic between the two
  synthesized fixtures.
- MPT 1327 CWSC Hamming-distance tolerance via the new
  `mpt1327_cwsc_tolerance` per-system config key. Default value
  is `2` (matches commercial MPT 1327 receivers on noisy on-air
  captures); operators replaying pre-stripped synthesized
  fixtures opt back into exact-match with `0`.

### Changed

- DMR Tier II pipeline `ClockGain` lowered from 0.025 to 0.015
  in [`internal/scanner/ccdecoder/pipelines.go`](internal/scanner/ccdecoder/pipelines.go)'s
  `newDMRTier2Pipeline`. The diagnostic test above surfaced that
  Tier II's BPTC(196, 96)-encoded payload's class-3 dibit
  overrepresentation (21.4% vs Tier III's 5.1%) and matching
  mean-transition magnitude (1.27 vs 0.90) slipped the
  Mueller-Müller clock loop at 0.025. The more conservative gain
  stays locked under the harder symbol distribution; live
  captures benefit equally. Lifts the
  `TestDaemonCCDecodesDMRTier2` `t.Skip` that's been in place
  since PR #184.

### Fixed

- `TestDaemonCCDecodesDMRTier2` no longer skips — see the
  Tier II ClockGain change above.

### Documentation

- New: [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md), [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md),
  [`docs/voice-calibration.md`](docs/voice-calibration.md),
  [`docs/gophertrunk.service`](docs/gophertrunk.service).
- Extended: [`docs/hardening.md`](docs/hardening.md) gains
  "Transport encryption (TLS)", "Health endpoint diagnostics",
  "Connection-drain window", and "Timeouts and keep-alive"
  sections.
- Extended: [`docs/vocoders.md`](docs/vocoders.md) gains
  "Voice calibration plumbing", "Knox / call-alert extension
  hook", and "DVSI backend layout" sections.
- Updated: README's `Status & known gaps` and `Roadmap`
  sections — MPT 1327 CWSC, DMR Tier II fixture, YSF on-air
  codec, and vocoder calibration plumbing all moved from
  "remaining follow-up" to "now shipping" or "real-air capture
  pending".
