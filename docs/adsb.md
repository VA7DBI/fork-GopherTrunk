# ADS-B / Aviation

GopherTrunk decodes **Automatic Dependent Surveillance — Broadcast**
(ADS-B) messages aircraft transponders broadcast on 1090 MHz.
ADS-B is the ICAO-mandated cooperative aviation surveillance
protocol — every commercial passenger flight, most general-
aviation, and all military aircraft over US / EU airspace
continuously broadcasts: ICAO 24-bit address, callsign,
barometric or GNSS altitude, lat/lon, ground speed, vertical
rate, true heading. This is the same data feeding every public
flight-tracking service (FlightRadar24, FlightAware, adsb.lol,
OpenSky); GopherTrunk now has the protocol layer to decode it
end-to-end on the operator's own SDR.

This page documents the **pipeline scaffolding**: what's wired,
what's persisted, what's queryable, and what the web panel
renders. The DSP layer (1 Msps PPM demodulation, Mode-S preamble
detection, 56 / 112-bit frame extraction) is tracked separately
under "What's pending" below.

## What's wired

### Events bus
- `events.KindAircraftReport` — published once per decoded
  Mode-S frame off the 1090 MHz channel. Payload is a
  `storage.AircraftReport` carrying the 24-bit ICAO address +
  message-kind-specific fields.

### Storage
- New SQLite table `aircraft_log` (append-only migration
  alongside `vessel_log`, `dsc_log`, `aprs_log`, `pager_log`):
  - `received_at`, `icao`, `icao_hex`, `kind`, `body`,
    `crc_valid`, `callsign`, `category`, `latitude`,
    `longitude`, `altitude_ft`, `has_position`, `has_altitude`,
    `ground_speed_kn`, `track_deg`, `vertical_rate_fpm`,
    `raw_hex`
  - Indexes on `(received_at)` and `(icao, received_at)`
- `storage.AircraftLog` bus subscriber writes one row per
  `KindAircraftReport` event.

### REST
- `GET /api/v1/adsb/aircraft?limit=N` — most recent reports,
  newest first. Default 200, max 5000. ADS-B is the highest-
  rate decoder (2-3 msg/s per aircraft on a busy channel) so
  tighter limits make sense for live rendering.

### Web panel
- `/adsb` — live list with columns:
  - Received (HH:MM:SS, daemon clock)
  - ICAO (6-char hex, the standard "tail identifier")
  - Kind (ident / airborne-pos / surface-pos / velocity / ...)
  - Callsign (for identification messages)
  - Lat / Lon (for position messages with a successful CPR
    global decode)
  - Alt (ft) (for airborne / surface position)
  - GS / Track (for velocity messages, subtype 1 / 2)
  - VR (fpm) (vertical rate, signed)
- CRC-failed frames highlight yellow.

## Protocol layer (`internal/radio/adsb`)

Pure-Go Mode-S parser. The bit-stream layer above (separate PR)
handles 1090 MHz PPM demodulation, preamble correlation, and
56 / 112-bit frame extraction. By the time bytes reach
`adsb.Decode` they're complete Mode-S frames with the trailing
24-bit CRC included.

- **CRC-24 codec** (`parse.go`) — Mode-S CRC with polynomial
  0xFFF409. Verifies DF 11 / 17 / 18 frames directly (zero
  residue over `message || crc`); for DF 0 / 4 / 5 / 20 / 21
  the trailing 24 bits = `CRC XOR ICAO`, so the parser
  recovers the ICAO address by XORing the computed CRC.
- **DF dispatch** (`adsb.go`) — recognises every documented
  downlink format; fully decodes DF 17 / 18 extended squitter
  (the operator-visible majority) and tags the others with
  the raw payload preserved.
- **TC dispatch** for extended squitter ME payloads:
  - **TC 1-4**: Identification — 8-char callsign decoded from
    the 6-bit ICAO alphabet (A-Z, space, 0-9, with trailing
    spaces / underscores stripped).
  - **TC 5-8**: Surface position — CPR-encoded.
  - **TC 9-18, 20-22**: Airborne position — CPR-encoded
    lat/lon + 12-bit Q-bit altitude (Q=1 = 25 ft resolution).
  - **TC 19**: Airborne velocity — subtypes 1/2 = ground
    speed + track, subtypes 3/4 = air speed + heading; common
    vertical-rate field across all subtypes.
- **CPR decode** (`cpr.go`) — globally-unambiguous lat/lon
  recovery from an even + odd CPR pair (DO-260B
  §2.2.3.2.3.7). The NL (number of longitude zones) lookup
  table mirrors the dump1090 reference implementation. The
  locally-referenced decode (single message against a known
  receiver location) is the obvious follow-up once the daemon
  caches an operator-configured reference position.

Validated against the canonical dump1090 / mode-s.org reference
samples:
- Identification `8D4840D6202CC371C32CE0576098` → ICAO 4840D6,
  callsign "KLM1023".
- Airborne-position CPR pair `8D40621D58C382D690C8AC2863A7`
  + `8D40621D58C386435CC412692AD6` → ICAO 40621D, lat
  52.2572 N, lon 3.91937 E, alt 38,000 ft.
- Airborne velocity `8D485020994409940838175B284F` → ICAO
  485020, GS 159 kn, track ≈ 183°, VR -832 fpm.

## What's pending

- **DSP receiver.** 1 Msps PPM demodulation at 1090 MHz with
  Mode-S preamble correlation and 56 / 112-bit frame
  extraction. The plan calls for extending
  `internal/dsp/tuner/channelizerbank.go` to support
  higher-rate taps, then a Mode-S demod that walks the IQ
  stream, correlates against the 8 µs preamble pattern, and
  hands extracted frames into `adsb.Decode`. Heaviest decoder
  in Phase 5 — requires a dedicated SDR tuned to 1090 MHz
  (typical RTL-SDR setup: PCB antenna + 1090 MHz filter +
  LNA).
- **Per-ICAO CPR pair-tracking.** The current parser emits
  even / odd CPR fields raw; a state machine that buffers the
  most-recent half per ICAO and calls `CPRDecodeGlobal` when
  both arrive within ~10 s would let position rows show
  globally-decoded lat/lon immediately. Same buffer location
  for the locally-referenced decode (when a reference
  position is configured).
- **Aircraft tracker.** An `aircraft_current` SQL view (or a
  separate live-state table indexed by ICAO) showing the
  latest known position / altitude / callsign per aircraft,
  joining identification + position + velocity rows over the
  last few minutes. Powers a "currently visible aircraft"
  panel distinct from the raw message log.
## Live map

Aircraft positions (once the per-ICAO CPR pairing lands) render
as purple markers on the shared Leaflet map at the top of
`/adsb` — callsign + altitude on hover, camera auto-fits to the
current rowset. The same `<PositionMap>` component renders on
`/aprs`, `/ais`, and `/dsc`.
