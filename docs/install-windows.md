# Installing GopherTrunk on Windows 11

This is the path the prebuilt installer lays down for you. Five
minutes from a fresh download to a working `gophertrunk sdr list`.

## 1. Download the installer

Go to the **[GopherTrunk releases page]** and download the
asset named:

```
gophertrunk-<version>-windows-amd64-setup.exe
```

If you'd rather skip the installer and run from a folder, grab the
matching `gophertrunk-<version>-windows-amd64.zip` and extract it
anywhere — the contents are the same.

> **Why is the download blocked?** Windows SmartScreen sometimes
> warns on installers it hasn't seen before. Click **More info →
> Run anyway**, or right-click the file → Properties → check
> **Unblock**. The installer is unsigned today; signing is on the
> roadmap.

## 2. Run the installer

Double-click `setup.exe` and accept the defaults. The installer:

- Copies `gophertrunk.exe` to `C:\Program Files\GopherTrunk\` —
  a single static binary, no DLLs to ship. **This is the only
  thing that goes in Program Files.**
- Asks you for **one data folder** (the "Select your GopherTrunk
  data folder" page after the Tasks step, defaulting to
  `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\GopherTrunk`). Everything that *isn't*
  the program lives here, in a tidy subfolder tree Setup creates:

  ```
  Documents\GopherTrunk\
    config\       config.yaml + your talkgroup / RID CSVs
    recordings\   voice-call recordings (.wav / .raw)
    iq\           raw IQ baseband captures
    exports\      CSV / PDF exports
    data\         calls.db + caches
    logs\         decoded-message logs
    web\          the browser consoles (standard + Signal Lab + Config Builder)
  ```

  You can point this anywhere you can write to — a USB stick, a
  network drive, your desktop. Setup seeds a starter `config.yaml`
  into `config\` (an existing one is never overwritten).
- Bundles **Zadig** (the WinUSB driver-binding tool) next to the
  daemon and adds a Start Menu shortcut "Install RTL-SDR driver
  (Zadig)" so you don't have to chase a separate download.
- Adds Start Menu entries for the daemon, the config template,
  the three **browser-based web consoles** (open them straight
  from `web\` — setup + quick-start guide: **[Web console]({{ '/web.html' | relative_url }})**),
  and these instructions.
- Optionally adds `C:\Program Files\GopherTrunk` to your system
  PATH so you can run `gophertrunk` from any PowerShell window
  (off by default — tick the "Add GopherTrunk to my PATH"
  checkbox during install if you want it).

When the wizard finishes, it'll offer to open this document, a
console window, Zadig (to bind the WinUSB driver — see §3), and
the web console in your default browser. All are harmless to skip;
the Zadig one defaults off.

## 3. Install the WinUSB driver via Zadig (one-time, for each dongle)

Windows ships an RTL-SDR DVB-T receiver driver by default — that
driver is what you'd use to watch broadcast TV, and it's the wrong
driver for SDR work. We need to swap it for **WinUSB** on a
per-device basis. The installer **bundles Zadig** (GPL-3.0, from
<https://zadig.akeo.ie>) so you don't have to chase a download.

1. Plug in the RTL-SDR dongle. The same flow works for any
   `0bda:2838` device — generic RTL-SDR Blog units, the **NooElec
   NESDR Smart v5**, and equivalent clones.
2. Launch Zadig via **Start Menu → GopherTrunk → "Install RTL-SDR
   driver (Zadig)"**. Approve the UAC prompt. (Alternatively, on the
   last page of the installer there's an unchecked **"Run Zadig now
   to bind the WinUSB driver"** option — tick it before clicking
   Finish.)
3. **Options → List All Devices** so the RTL-SDR shows up.
4. From the dropdown, pick the dongle. It'll typically appear as
   **Bulk-In, Interface (Interface 0)** or **RTL2832U** (the
   NESDR Smart v5 reports as `RTL2838UHIDIR`).
5. With **WinUSB** selected as the target driver, click
   **Replace Driver** (or **Install Driver**, first time).
6. Wait ~10 seconds for the success dialog.

You only do this once per dongle. If you ever want the dongle to
work as a TV tuner again, run Zadig in reverse and pick the
manufacturer driver.

## 4. Verify everything works

Open **Windows Terminal** (or PowerShell) and run:

```powershell
gophertrunk version
gophertrunk sdr list
```

`sdr list` should print one line per attached dongle with its
driver, index, serial, and product string. The TUNER and gains
columns are blank by design — they need the device to be opened
(USB claim + RTL2832U baseband init + I2C tuner probe), which `sdr
list` skips so the command is fast and never collides with a
running daemon. Pass `--probe` when you want those columns filled:

```powershell
gophertrunk sdr list --probe
```

If you see `no SDR devices found` and you're sure the dongle is
plugged in, the WinUSB driver swap probably didn't take — re-run
Zadig with **Options → List All Devices** checked and verify the
"Driver" column shows **WinUSB** for your dongle.

If you didn't tick the PATH option during install, run from the
install folder instead:

```powershell
cd "C:\Program Files\GopherTrunk"
.\gophertrunk.exe sdr list
```

## 5. Configure and start the daemon

The installer asked you for a data folder (default
`Documents\GopherTrunk`) and seeded a `config.yaml` in its
`config\` subfolder. It also set the `GOPHERTRUNK_CONFIG` user
environment variable to point at that file, so the daemon discovers
it automatically — no `-config` flag needed. (A second variable,
`GOPHERTRUNK_HOME`, points at the data folder itself.) Use the Start
Menu shortcut "Edit my config.yaml (Notepad)" to open it, set your
device serial + control-channel frequencies, and save.

The seeded `config.yaml` uses **config-relative paths**
(`../recordings`, `../data/calls.db`, `../iq`, `../logs`), so the
daemon writes recordings, the database, IQ captures, and logs into
the sibling folders under your data root automatically — no absolute
paths to edit. You can still hard-code an absolute path (or use
`%GOPHERTRUNK_HOME%\...`) if you want files somewhere else.

Then start the daemon:

```powershell
gophertrunk run
```

The daemon prints `config: loaded <path>` on startup so you can
confirm it picked up the right file. To override (e.g. running
against a second config for testing), use `-config`:

```powershell
gophertrunk run -config "C:\path\to\other.yaml"
```

If you drop multiple `*.yaml` files into the `config\` folder
(e.g. `config.yaml` + `prod.yaml` + `test.yaml`), the daemon prints
a numbered menu on startup and asks which one to load. Pick the
number, press Enter, and that file is used. Set `-config` or
`GOPHERTRUNK_CONFIG` to skip the prompt for unattended runs (a
non-interactive launch — Windows service, scheduled task —
auto-selects the first file and logs the choice).

A read-only reference copy of the full annotated template lives at
`C:\Program Files\GopherTrunk\config.example.yaml` (Start Menu →
"Configuration template").

Logs stream to the terminal. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop cleanly.

For a long-running setup, register GopherTrunk as a Windows service
with [NSSM](https://nssm.cc) — that's the simplest path until a
native service manifest ships:

```powershell
nssm install GopherTrunk "C:\Program Files\GopherTrunk\gophertrunk.exe" `
  run -config "%USERPROFILE%\Documents\GopherTrunk\config\config.yaml"
nssm set GopherTrunk AppDirectory "C:\Program Files\GopherTrunk"
nssm start GopherTrunk
```

> Point `-config` at the `config.yaml` inside your data folder's
> `config\` subfolder. A service runs as a different account, so use
> the absolute path here rather than relying on the per-user
> `GOPHERTRUNK_CONFIG` variable.

## Uninstall

**Settings → Apps → Installed apps → GopherTrunk → Uninstall.**
The uninstaller removes the install folder and every Start Menu
entry, strips GopherTrunk from your PATH (if you opted in), and
clears the `GOPHERTRUNK_CONFIG` / `GOPHERTRUNK_HOME` env vars. It
then asks whether to also delete the Setup-managed parts of your
data folder — the `config`, `data`, `logs`, and `web` subfolders.
The default is **No**. Even if you say Yes, your **captures**
(`recordings`, `iq`, `exports`) are always kept so you never lose
recordings on an uninstall.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                                | Likely cause                                       |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `gophertrunk` not recognised           | PATH wasn't added — open a fresh terminal or run from `C:\Program Files\GopherTrunk` directly. |
| `sdr list` prints nothing              | Zadig WinUSB swap didn't take — see step 3.        |
| `usb: device disconnected` mid-stream  | The DVB driver re-attached itself — re-run Zadig. |
| `WinUsb_Initialize` fails              | The dongle is bound to the wrong driver — re-run Zadig and pick **WinUSB**. |
| `ERROR_GEN_FAILURE` / `device rejected request` on `sdr list` | Clone-dongle cold-start quirk — a USB control transfer is NAK'd during bring-up. v0.2.x absorbs this automatically: the sacrificial warmup probe, a control-pipe clear-and-retry, and (for R820T/R828D tuner init on NESDR v5 silicon) a per-chunk retry + chunk-size halving fallback all recover from it. If it still persists, the probe error prints a **`--- USB diagnostics ---`** block (bound driver, device/config descriptors, a control-IN read probe) — copy that whole block into a GitHub issue. Meanwhile: try a different USB port (front vs. rear use different host controllers), avoid hubs and extension cables, and confirm `gophertrunk sdr doctor` shows **WinUSB** (not libusbK) bound to interface 0. |
| Smart Screen blocks the installer      | Right-click → Properties → Unblock, or **More info → Run anyway**. |
