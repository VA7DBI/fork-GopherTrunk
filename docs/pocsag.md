# POCSAG paging decoder

GopherTrunk now decodes the **POCSAG** (Post Office Code
Standardisation Advisory Group, CCIR Recommendation 584) wireline
FSK pager protocol — the dominant pager protocol globally and the
one most fire / EMS departments use for tone-out dispatch
forwarding. The first PR lands the protocol layer (codeword parsing,
BCH(31,21), batch carve-up, numeric + alphanumeric message
reassembly) with thorough unit tests. The DSP wiring (FM demod →
bit slicer → sync detector → batch decoder → bus event) is a
focused follow-up PR.

## What's here today

- **`internal/radio/framing/bch_pocsag.go`** — BCH(31,21) encoder
  + brute-force minimum-Hamming-distance decoder, plus the
  trailing-parity helper POCSAG uses to stretch the code to 32
  wire bits. Generator polynomial: g(x) = x^10 + x^9 + x^8 + x^6
  + x^5 + x^3 + 1 (CCIR 584 §3.2.1).
- **`internal/radio/pager/pocsag/codeword.go`** — 32-bit codeword
  struct, sync (`0x7CD215D8`) + idle (`0x7A89C197`) pattern
  recognition, address/message/function decoding, parity check
  on the trailing bit.
- **`internal/radio/pager/pocsag/batch.go`** — batch carve-up
  (sync + 16 codewords × 8 frame slots), frame-slot index
  resolution, full-RIC reconstruction (18-bit address codeword
  field + 3-bit slot index → 21-bit pager address).
- **`internal/radio/pager/pocsag/message.go`** — numeric (5 BCD
  digits per codeword, with the CCIR 584 extended-character
  table: 0-9, *, U, space, -, ), ( ) and alphanumeric (7-bit
  LSB-first ASCII packed across 20-bit message fields)
  decoders. Trailing space-padding is trimmed.

## What's pending

- **End-to-end IQ validation.** The receiver code is wired and
  builds against the full pipeline, but the synthetic FM-modulated
  IQ test is skipped pending real captured fixtures (a `.cfile`
  under `samples/pocsag/`). The receiver's API surface is unit-
  tested (Options validation, ctx cancel, nil input); the protocol
  + storage + REST + UI stack is covered by their respective
  package tests. The remaining piece is tuning the
  integrator-and-slicer timing against real on-air bits — likely
  swapping the running-mean slicer for a proper Mueller-Müller +
  matched-filter combination once we have signal to calibrate
  against.
- **Multi-channel POCSAG from one wideband SDR.** Today each
  paging.pocsag entry pins one SDR to one frequency. A follow-up
  will add a DDC tap so several narrow POCSAG channels inside
  one wideband SDR's bandwidth decode concurrently — the same
  primitive `role: wideband` uses for DMR Tier II.
- **FLEX.** A separate, higher-rate (1600 / 3200 / 6400 sps)
  Motorola pager protocol that shares the operator workflow but
  needs its own FEC (Reed-Muller + two-of-three majority decoder)
  and frame structure. Documented as a planned follow-up; the
  framework added here is the foundation.

## Configuration

```yaml
paging:
  pocsag:
    - serial: "antenna-pi"       # SDR serial (must be in sdr.devices
                                 # or sdr.rtl_tcp)
      frequency_hz: 152_007_500  # local commercial paging / fire
                                 # dispatch / DAPNET / etc.
      baud_hz: 1200              # 512 / 1200 / 2400; default 1200
```

The daemon retunes the named SDR to `frequency_hz` on startup and
runs the receiver against its IQ stream via the iqtap broker.
Pages flow onto `events.KindPagerMessage`, land in the SQLite
`pager_log` table, and render on the web `/pagers` panel.

## What's shipped now

- **Syncer + page assembler** — `pocsag.Syncer` consumes a bit
  stream (one bit per byte), locks on the sync codeword (with
  polarity-inverse fallback so a flipped FM demod still works),
  carves out batches, decodes each codeword through BCH(31,21),
  and reassembles pages by correlating address codewords with
  the message codewords that follow them. Idle codewords +
  uncorrectable codewords + the next address terminate an
  in-progress page.
- **Bus event** — `events.KindPagerMessage` payload is a
  `storage.PagerMessage` carrying RIC, function code, encoding
  ("numeric" | "alpha"), decoded text, and total BCH bit-error
  count.
- **SQLite persistence** — `storage.PagerLog` subscribes to the
  bus event and writes to a new `pager_log` table (mirrors
  `call_log` / `location_log`). Retention sweeper can be extended
  later when growth becomes a concern.
- **REST endpoint** — `GET /api/v1/pager/messages?limit=N`
  returns the most recent N pages (default 200, max 5000),
  newest first.
- **Web panel** — `/pagers` renders the live page list:
  Received / RIC / Function / Encoding / Body / BER columns,
  polled every 5 s. Non-zero BER is highlighted yellow.

## Testing

The protocol layer has 13 unit tests covering:

- BCH(31,21) round-trip (encode → decode = no errors), single-
  bit and double-bit error correction, triple-bit rejection
- Sync + idle codeword recognition
- Address + message codeword round-trips (encode → wire → decode
  reproduces the original fields)
- Single-bit error correction at every codeword position
- Parity-bit flip detection
- Frame-slot mapping (word index → slot index → RIC reconstruction)
- Batch carve-up with a synthetic address + message at a known slot
- Numeric BCD decode (including the CCIR 584 extended symbols,
  trailing-space trimming, LSB-first nibble order)
- Alphanumeric ASCII reassembly (7-bit LSB-first, character
  straddling 20-bit boundaries)
- Mixed-codeword slices (address + message words in one buffer
  — DecodeNumeric / DecodeAlpha ignore non-message codewords)

## Why now

Most operator workflows that already use GopherTrunk for trunked
voice want the local fire / EMS pager traffic alongside —
dispatch goes out on the trunked system AND on a paging
frequency, and seeing the pager text helps confirm "this
specific tone-out matched these specific crews."

Building on the iqtap broker (PR #365), the eventual DSP
pipeline will tap the same IQ stream the trunking decoder reads
on a separate broker subscriber, so adding POCSAG decode doesn't
double the USB / CPU cost of the SDR.
